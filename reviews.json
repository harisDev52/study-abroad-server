The course was all driven by team work and very practical. One of my favourite modules was ‘specialised skill’ where we got to explore independently a random skill of our choice, I chose claymation animation and spent time in that department collaborating with my production design skills! The bower campus is in one of the largest parks Aston gate, surrounded by nature, wildlife including lots of deers!! It was very grounding when your studying. The vibrant bubbly city of Bristol is also like no other. It has a great music scene, artistic cafes and incredible restaurants and many vintage shops. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "I graduated from the University of West of England in July 2021. I started my undergraduate degree in 2018 and my all-around journey throughout the program was a roller coaster ride. Upon my arrival in this class at the beginning of the semester, I had 2 different sets of expectation. I thought this class would show me all my possibilities and open my eyes to which major I should declare. I did not know how exactly this would happen, but I do not teach at a university. My second thought was that I would not learn anything; that this class would cover basic academic success solutions and strategies that had been preached through out all my years in high school. Either way I expected this class to slide by, and do well with little to no effort. I made a lot of assumptions about this class, before even looking at the syllabus, or attending a class. One of them was how easy this class would be; I figured it would be an easy A. In this I was wrong, this class was not at all as easy as I had expected. I had to work significantly harder than I planned. There were many more projects, and assignments that I had not accounted for. Even though I had expected the class to be easier, I was able to quickly adjust. All thanks to my mentors and friend.\nThis college not only groomed my knowledge of the specialized course but also assisted with my personal development. Along with the studies, the University offered With different opportunities like intercollegiate competition, guest lectures from renowned personalities, and personal development sessions. Before joining University, I was not so good at communication or never had my appearance in any college activities, but the mentors were so flexible and supportive, they encouraged me to participate in the college scheme. As said, better than a thousand days of delivery study is one day with a great mentor. Accordingly, my four years at the university with exceptionally incredible mentor, my experience at university was promising.",

There, I had the opportunity to connect my learning experience with a city that deepens into a sustainability scenario day after day. \n\nOverall, my study experience was outstanding. It is with much joy and happiness that I recommend it entirely. If I could improve anything, perhaps, it would be the opportunity to bring all that knowledge into practice; however, given the circumstances, I understand that was not possible at the time.",

Your university should be your home. \n \n\n That’s exactly what Falmouth University is, Falmouth University is home. \n \n\n Despite pushing you when you need it the most, lecturers and support staff truly understand what it means to live a balanced and holistic life. From interview to graduation, they are invested in getting to know students on an academic level, but a personal one to what makes them tick, their motivations, hobbies, and areas of concern. This outlook, s so unique to Falmouth and nurtures creativity like no other University I applied for.\n \n\n Currently, I am in my second year studying Journalism and Creative Writing at Falmouth and I don’t have a bad word to say - and not only because I live within walking distance to the Stunning south Cornish coastline and get to learn on a campus resembling a tropical jungle!\n I have had the opportunity to explore all sectors of my subject extensively. Through hands-on workshops, I am learning and establishing the areas I enjoy and the areas in which I excel. My interests have been nurtured by the lecturers and I am currently in the process of applying for summer internships at household names such as: ‘BBC Good Food. \n \n\n Something so unique about Falmouth is the way you learn. Staff spend teaching you not what to think, but instead how to think. How to form well-rounded opinions and put media out into the world that is well rounded and uniquely yours. The Focus is on using your voice to fill the gaps in the industry of your choice. This, in my opinion, is far more valuable and enjoyable than countless hours of learning and reciting theory. You get a real sense of accomplishment and take a proactive role in mapping out your future. \n \n\n If you want your University to be more than just your University, if you want your University to be your home, Falmouth might just be the place for you. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Practical learning is more self directed- you sign up for tutorials given by technicians or research yourself. \nDidnt deal with pandemic well, very little if any support for mental health avaliable (I asked in September for prior illnesses and was closed due to long waiting list. Never got back to me). I lived alone and no help was given to meet others. Was a very lonely year after moving country.

By the end of my second year, I will be more able to give a much more accurate encapsulation of the holistic university experience and QMUL may gain the final star. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I love the supportive, inquisitive environment on my course between students and lecturers alike, with fun lectures and lab sessions and organised systems if you ever need help from jobs to mental health. I feel I am always encouraged to go beyond the scope of studying and provided with many resources I can utilise. The only problem I have is that scheduling can be an issue, for example, workshops on assignments clash with timing for our laboratory practicals. However, this issue has little effect on my overall student experience. \n \n\n The campus is vast and green, with a lovely canal-side study area looking across to Mile End Park. My most memorable experience of my first year at university is my accommodation overlooking said canal and park. It’s hard to believe the area is situated in such a centralised part of East London. It’s the perfect environment to balance the intensity of study and the calmness of relaxation\n \n\n Anyone I talk to about QMUL, I say this.

          "review": "This is my third year as a medical student studying at QMUL. Therefore, I can positively confirm of the excellent teaching curriculum and inclusive environment provided to me the last two years.\n The university focuses on integrated learning, focusing on small-groups, as well as proving an introduction to clinical training. First, alongside lectures, we are also provided excellent online material; e-earnings, supporting videos to academic material and extra tutorials and supporting documents. These have really helped me during exam season and have given me a well-rounded perspective of each module. Moreover, there are 6-8 person sessions to discuss medical scenarios and answer questions, as well as aiding face-to-face sessions of physiology and anatomy. It has been very comforting having a more individualized teaching, where one can focus on your queries. Further, during the pre-clinical years, we have the opportunity to experience GP placements, therefore being in contact with the medical profession early on. These experiences have guided me to the clinical years of medical school and prepared for hospital placements. Nonetheless, the curriculum is extensive and detailed. It can be very dense and difficult to learn, having to constantly “keep on top of things” and revise throughout the year to ensure you are learning the material. The university though tries to help and best prepare you to succeed and pass the year. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Thus the real lesson to learn from studying Maths is, how to study effectively and learning from your peers.\n \n\n Finally, the most transferrable skill that one can acquire from studying Mathematics is problem solving as the subject mostly teaches a person how to think outside the box, conditioning one to solve problems with outside of the box thinking. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The MSc in Creative Arts and Mental Health are definitely unique in its take on the intersection of the two fields, putting it in the world top for what&#39;s often considered to be an &quot;alternative take on well-being&quot;. However, it equally tackles the artistic industry and how we may help change it for the better. The MSc is barely 5 years old, and though the course content strives to reflect the times it&#39;s taught in - there&#39;s potential for a more steady base of knowledge or &quot;identity&quot; for the course. It&#39;s framework and trajectory can appear vague and broad, as its flexibility and openness to individualisation from time to time becomes too good an asset. Thus, requiring the students themselves to know what they want to put into the work and what they&#39;d like to learn and achieve from it - to a greater extent. Much like other postgraduate studies, it hold one accountable and requires a lot, other than academical skills. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

In addition, university provides all the necessary facilities for learning activities, hence students are well-equipped to achieve the best possible academic results and increase their level of knowledge in their chosen degrees. As one can see, academically-wise this university is one of the best. Nevertheless, from my stance, social life of the university isn’t as vibrant as it’s academic side. I think, Queen Mary could definitely integrate students more into the university life as it will help in unifying the students into one big student community. So far, I don’t see cohesion as such amongst the students. While Queen Mary could be proud of its high-class worldwide academic reputation, social life is something it could work on.",

          "review": "My aspiration to follow my interests into my postgraduate education promptly steered me towards a high-quality education in the UK. I joined for an MSc in renewable engineering at UCLan.\n\nHowever, as I started going to Uni, I discovered that the degree was not congruent with what I had expected it to be. Coming from a background in civil engineering, I expected renewable engineering to embody sustainability in a constructional aspect, however, the course largely featured electrical & mechanical engineering as a mainstay. I realized that this degree was not one that I had an aptitude for, and appealed to my course leader for transferring to a different course that I felt more comfortable in. However, because the course I wanted to swap to was not running academically at the time of my request I was advised to follow through with the course I had taken in the first place. I was left with no choice to stick to a degree that I was not interested in completing. However, after coming to the realization that I am not captivated by the degree, I was studying for, one that I do not see myself building a career on, I opted for an exit award PG certificate, two years into studying.\nI endured and successfully passed all my modules as part of the diploma, however, I was unable to contribute effectively towards the dissertation as I felt very distant & detached from the topic I was advised to choose which had more to do with electrical engineering than it did with sustainable construction.\nI felt bouts of anxiety and depression throughout my study as I could not imagine a future where I had to work in a career that I was not interested in.\nAlthough unfortunate that I was unable to receive a master's degree, I realized It would mean more to me if I had a degree that I aligned with my aptitude.\nAlthough the course I chose was not the right one for me, I refused to give up on my dream of attaining an Msc. and completing my graduate education in the U.K.\n\n\nI am still very passionate about what I know I have an aptitude for. And I feel the vehement need to complete my graduate studies in a degree that adds to my background in civil engineering. I aspire to join a 1 year MSc program so that I may meet the educational expectations I have for myself and for my career.",

          "review": "I have studied at Primary & Secondary school, Folkestone, Canterbury and Dover College, University of Kent, Shibuya Gaigo Gakuin language School and Uclan has by far been the worst educational institution I have studied under. Being a 'Mature' student I have a lot of experience outside of school unlike many students. \n\nUclan has used the Corona virus as an excuse with pleasure for many of my complaints even when it is not even remotely related. When I attempted to make my complaints official, the member of Uclan I spoke to used many polite words to palm off every problem I had and tried to tell me it has nothing to do with Uclan (I have come to resent the impoliteness of the people of Preston and whenever people are nice I have learnt that they either want money or are enforced by their job to be nice).\n\nI had to purchase a headset due to classes being online and after hours of attempting to talk to a member of Uclan to ask for a reimbursement for the headset they refused me and offered £20 worth of book tokens instead. I accepted the pitiful charity alternative but never even received the book tokens. I was also pushed to purchase a camera for my PC as I didn't own one and because Uclan refused to provide or buy me one I refused. Therefore every class I had I was belittled by tutors for not having one receiving comments such as \"I'd ask Conor for an answer however I don't even know if he is there I can't even see him he could be doing anything\". The tone wasn't suggesting a joke however I took it as jest but after this happened a handful of times I finally replied with \"I would have a camera but Uclan refused to fund me so we're both stuck with this\" and I was cut off and asked to move onto the question. I understand classes are limited with time but I couldn't help feel palmed off. I feel as though as I am paying the university 9 grand a year, I expect perfect levels of student duty of care but have received none.\n\nThere was possibly a dozen classes in a classroom and five of those classes had technical difficulties to the point where almost the entire class was lost due to these technical difficulties. Again I would like to state here what on earth is my 9 grand a year going to? Because it obviously isn't for general maintenance, it isn't for student welfare and it isn't for sitting at home for almost the entire academic year. Because of the Corona virus and students where forced to use their own computers instead of the university's facilities. The university should have been significantly cheaper. The university probably profited ridiculously off the misery and stress of all the students trying to attend classes at home. I personally have had a newborn baby this year and studying from home has not been easy. However when this was mentioned during my complaint I was palmed off again. \n\nThe university is almost completely reliant on the University website 'Blackboard' and Blackboard makes me wonder if I even needed to pay 9 grand a year for a website. If it wasn't for the degree at the end of the course, I could source everything myself and self-teach myself everything considering this year we didn't use any classrooms or other facilities (I used the library a handful of times however the Uclan library had little sufficient sources for my research). The first month or so I was calling technical support daily to understand how to reach all of my online classes as i\nI received no Emails giving me any information, I completely missed freshers week and did not know how to access anything. I wasn't alone with this issue either.\n\nI am furious with the price for what you get, I pay £380 a year for my Gym membership and they are always there for its members when they need them. Every institution I have ever studied under has been priced understandably. However this university is a complete scam. For 9,000+ pounds a year I would expect my every need to be met and done so with care, working classrooms with working equipment. Rental equipment just like rental library books when necessary for students. I hate Uclan, but they don't care that I hate Uclan because I'm just an ID number paying my fee and in four years I will be gone and they can continue to con new ID numbers out of their thousands of pounds.\n\nPros-\nOnline lessons where recorded for revising. This was very helpful and classes should be recorded offline also. \n\nMake sure Uclan is your last choice and only choose Uclan if you don't have very good grades and they are the only institution that will accept your low grades.",

Although for general support for other things you are dependent on your own more and sometimes they can be inflexible for things like payment scheduling. Which needs to be changed as other fees such as rent also determine when you can pay, especially since a loan gives three set different payments, having to pay tuition should also be split yearly by the same manner rather than expect full payment by January.

Feedback from the assignments is supposed to exist, but in reality the professors, apparently, have more important things to do. \nIf you as a student genuinely care about the education you pursue, not ready to deal with half of your grades not even closely representing your knowledge - then stay away from Hull.",

However I was proved very wrong, Hull had a really great community with so much going on. It’s super cheap which is really handy as a student, and everything is so close together it’s so convenient and cheap to go anywhere. The nightlife was surprisingly good and if you want more it’s so close to bigger cities that going for a quick night in Leeds or Manchester or London isn’t even that big a deal. I also took part in a lot of union activities, joining committees, helping out with events, going to socials, etc. and they were all so much fun! It just feels like something i wouldn’t have taken the leap to do in a university in a bigger city. Also in terms of jobs, I did loads of paying part time university jobs and there are also so many jobs outside of the university in just the surrounding areas so you wouldn’t have to travel far.\n \n\n Anyway in summary, I’m really glad I went to Hull and i don’t think i would have had as good a time anywhere else. It’s a really great University and place overall. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

As that is often required to have to get a job in the animation field. \nLittle help in getting work. \n\nSome teachers were great an helpful and some lacked the experience of teaching skills. \n\nIt felt bit outdated to spend majority of the time doing cel-animations instead of doing it on a software there was perhaps one or two lessons about animation software.

It was a lot for little old me to transition into higher education from a different country, but with the university&#39;s help I was able to bond and connect with other students in the same position. I learned British politics, history, and how to write/research papers to that reflect a university scholar. With these skills I was able to branch out and apply to their Journalism program on their Medway campus. I met my best friend and had a lot of fun with hands on camera work and media studies, as well as learning how to write and interview the public. The only downsides that I experienced during my four years of higher education was that I felt my department was very disorganized. With those feelings, I applied to be a student representative to see what it what other students don’t see on the day to day. The disorganization that my fellow students felt came from a lot of department wide confusion and lack of communication which lead to assumptions. Furthermore, I wished that the teachers would help you more with the preparation of the “graduate funk.” After graduating in this weird climate (job market, economic recession/inflation, etc) I feel like I didn’t have a lot of direction of where I could have taken my career. Not everyone who studies journalism wants to work/report on local news or wants to be a copywriter. All in all, I had a lot of fun during university which lead to a lifelong friendship and pushed me to strive for a bright future, but the cons of university brought a tsunami of burnout and anxiety (especially with two years of COVID-19 interrupting my studies). Through my own research and connections, I had to solve my own &quot;problems&quot; which, in the end, I guess what going to university is all about. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Many of these sites are used for social functions as Kent has many societies and events that allow students and meet and mingle in a fun positive setting. The university is also only a short bus ride into Canterbury and 40mins from Kent’s beach towns. My degree offers a huge amount of variety with the modules I was allowed to pick, included optional modules that were outside my school. The lecturers are friendly and supportive willing to answers questions and help with essays. There are also student services that offering pastoral support e.g., counselling and advice for those who need it. They also have a career service that host events with hiring experts and businesses to offer clarity of what they’re looking for. Additionally, they host 1.1 meeting with students to discuss careers goals, resumes, cover letters and mock interviews. Kent is known as the European university, so they offer serval study and work placement in Europe and the wider world. My main complaint would the night life in Canterbury, while the campus itself has a nightclub the city itself could do better and also the shops on campus should be more varied and budget friendly with the main options being Co-op and Caffé Nero. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The campus is not an intimidating size and is easy to find things (besides for the Rutherford and Elliot buildings). I felt the Uni was the perfect size because it wasn’t so big that there’s an overwhelming amount of stuff going on, and you’re able to make connections a bit easier, but it also wasn’t too small, so there’s enough things for you to do and discover. It has a very international/European feel and so no matter your background, you can find like-minded people. The club on campus (venue) is always a good time, especially every Wednesday night. Drinking culture is very big, and you’ll find that everywhere in the UK but there’s also no pressure to participate if that’s not for you. The Uni is in the small city of Canterbury and it is a beautiful and amazing place to live. If you prefer a bigger city, Canterbury might not be for you. However, it is only an hour from london and is also much cheaper so it is particularly good for students, especially those who are budget conscious. In my particular degree, there are really good professors and interesting modules, however I would personally love a bigger variety of assignments, as my degree is very heavily essay based. Which in many ways can be good, but can also get redundant. However, I’ve learned a lot about academic writing which will be a useful tool in the future.

The university has tried to keep the 'feeling' of university alive during the Covid-19 pandemic and have gone to great measures to ensure that no student is left alienated or behind in the last year. I will miss the university when I leave as I have made many great memories.\n\nThe only Issue I have had with Kent is the ongoing dispute regarding PhD students and their salary, I do not believe that the university has acted fairly towards its PhD students and have not communicated their side of the argument clearly, seemingly attemping to halt negotiation between PhD students and the university.",

I had access to some of the best facilities at the campus as well. Starting from the well-stocked libraries to specific study areas for Postgrad students, each facility was absolutely curated to support the students in every way possible. The only drawback that I could mention was that the Covid pandemic struck during my year abroad, which unfortunately left a significant impact on my academics and other prospects. Originally the classes were conducted on campus, however due to the pandemic, classes were scheduled online and the labs had to shut down due to government mandates.

I found myself quite frustrated a lot of the time as it was hard to converse with tutors and I’d often feel ignored when I had an issue bar one or two tutors. I reached out a few times to tutors regarding mental health issues and it wasn’t dealt with - at all. I like how you could collaborate a lot with peers and work in groups and by yourself. I do think this course is beneficial in today’s world as you gain a lot of experience in a lot of different fields so it is a good option if you know you’re interested in media or design but your not too sure which direction you want to go in just yet. I found that some career paths where often looked down on by tutors and they’d give negative feedback about personal or design choices. Definitely for people that are logical not necessarily creative although you will need an element of creativity for third year.

The Warwick campus presents itself as a safe haven for students attending the university, it definitely was one for me when I lived on campus last year at bluebell. I thoroughly enjoyed my walks around the woodlands surrounding my accommodation, the bluebell lake was a favourite spot of mine when I needed time to myself, the geese however, as Warwick legend states can be a little daunting but is one of the many things unique to the university. I have loved every minute that I have been a part of this lovely community, and I know when I graduate next year, I will definitely miss my daily trips to the library. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "I&#39;ve been at Uni of Warwick for almost two years now, studying Modern Languages and Linguistics. It truly is a university like no other. With its brilliant location in the middle of the country, transport options are phenomenal, with direct trains to London and the North, and only thirty minutes away from Birmingham, the UK&#39;s second-largest city.\nThe campus itself is wonderful. As it&#39;s based just outside the city of Coventry, so much greenery surrounds the post-modern architecture of the academic buildings and accommodation. Woodland paths surround the campus and a river even runs behind it, making it the perfect campus for those nature-lovers. I enjoyed walks each day around campus and through the woodlands when I lived on campus, in Jack Martin, last year.\nOne of the main advantages of Warwick is the ability to combine courses. You can add a language to pretty much any course to give you that extra boost in job prospects (or if you simply want to learn a new/post-A-Level language). There are endless modules for each course too. This means that everyone at Warwick has a unique course, which is something that I personally love about the university. \nSomething which is very apt for today&#39;s world is the quality of the Wellbeing Services. With firsthand experience, I can tell you that the services that Warwick provides are outstanding and incomparable to any other UK university.\nThe only major negative is, in fact, the location. For second years above, we have to make a compromise and live a bit further away from campus, either in Leamington Spa or Coventry. This entails a 40-minute bus ride or 20-minute car journey each day to campus, which can be a negative but something which we all live with and it&#39;s not as bad as we first thought!\nI&#39;ve loved my time at Warwick and look forward to the next two years I spend there. I feel very lucky to have gotten the chance to study here. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "The program that I am currently studying in History and Politics which means that every year I do two modules on each side. Due to how related history and politics can be at times, I find that I can draw on examples from either side of the course to help answer a question or to shape my thought. \n\nIf you choose to do History and Politics note that to a degree your options will be limited. For example, in Year 1 you don&#39;t have an option for Politics and only one option for History. In Year 2 you also have one mandatory module for politics. It might feel limiting at first but usually, even the mandatory modules help develop your thought and apply them to the rest of the modules.\n\nThe program encourages you to develop your thought through not only a variety of readings and additional material but also through seminars. The seminars usually have a diverse group of thought, so you often find your views being challenged constructively. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the modules provide a variety of readings and additional material to support you. Having said that, if you struggle with reading through large text then it might be an issue. Although the university tries hard to keep the text as short as possible, do not be surprised if some weeks you have 100 pages to read from each module. \n\nFinally, the programme&#39;s examination style varies per the module chosen, but all modules have you writing two essays, one typically 1500 and the other 3000 words, these essays are not timed and instead you have to submit them when the deadline is due.\n\nOverall, if you are interested in both history and politics and are willing to make some sacrifices in terms of choices, this programme is fantastic. It is challenging yet rewarding. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

There’s also lots of places to buy food and drinks including in the student’s union. \nI&#39;ve found that the Warwick community is also very friendly and welcoming wherever you go. Doing Liberal Arts, my department is very small which means I have a close relationship with both others on my course and my seminar tutors which makes the course so enjoyable! There are so many ways to interact with the community such as university organised events and societies. There are societies for every hobby and interest which makes it easy to meet people and find friends with similar interests to you. \nIf I could, I would improve the student support services, especially those for mental health. There is constant access to community safety and people at the university to make students and staff feel safe and comfortable However, the mental health services can be difficult to access and there are limited services available.\nAnother drawback for some is that it is not within walkable distance to town centres such as Coventry and Leamington Spa. However, if you&#39;re willing to take the buses which run regularly to both eon this isn&#39;t too much of an issue. \n <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

As you live on campus during your first year, you are bound to meet so many people, and the fairs and activities that the university sets up encourage this! My favourite thing about Warwick is the campus, it is so familiar yet always changing! I loved getting to know the campus during my first year and finding my go-to study spots, but also admiring the new architecture. There are countless renovations and projects that make it feel like the university is really putting their money and effort back into you! What I really enjoy at Warwick is also the community. As most of its courses are highly ranked, you are surrounded by typically like-minded people, and the lecturers, coming from all over the world, bring their unique viewpoint to the subject, something that I believe is rare at other university. In Psychology, what really drew me in was the emphasis on research and building these skills.

It also covers key theoretical perspectives that are used to analyze and understand these inequalities, such as critical race theory, feminist theory, and intersectionality.\n\nThe course is delivered by experienced and knowledgeable lecturers who are experts in their respective fields. The teaching is interactive, with a strong emphasis on group work and peer discussion, allowing students to learn from each other&#39;s perspectives and experiences. The course also provides ample opportunities for networking and collaboration, both within the class and with external organizations.\n <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Everything around the campus is targeted and catered towards student life, compared to some city-based universities which try to cater to everyone.\n \n\n My course was quite challenging, being a joint honours option, but it also allowed me to explore one of Warwick&#39;s biggest strengths: its flexibility in choosing modules and options. Within the Maths and Physics departments, once you&#39;ve fulfilled your course regulations (usually about 90-120 credits of options, each module ranging from 6 credits, all the way to 15), you&#39;re free to try out modules from across almost every department as part of your degree. I took advantage of this by selecting options in Computer Science and Statistics, giving me an edge in careers later.\n \n\n Speaking of careers, Warwick is advertised often as a target university for graduate employers, and this holds up true. Compared to most of my friends, I felt that I had the widest range of support when it came to discussing careers and options for my future, with essentially unlimited bookings for careers meetings, dedicated job boards, and subject-specific careers fairs going on all the time every year. \n \n\n My few complaints with the university lie with only some of the academics and some policies about the COVID-19 pandemic. My entire final year was done online and it was quite difficult for me, with support understandably lacking during this period. However, if I had to limit myself to just my first and second years, the university would get 5 stars. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Although the first and second year were online due to the pandemic, the university stayed active and was very supportive and understanding of students anxiety. It has great events that allows students to make connections, seek career help and opportunities and just generally have fun whilst studying. When I started, the university was not high in technology but this year, it has been improving. There is also funding available for students who do not get student loans and they are very helpful. Campus life is full of life and vibrancy every day of the week and there is lots of room to study.\n \n\n The only thing I would say is that there is any sockets in big lecture halls which is a little inconvenient. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The amount of support everyone receives from the professors is astounding, classes are very well organised (most of the time) and above all, my course is very well-structured. I am in my final year studying languages, and I have loved my programme. The course itself had many interesting modules throughout the years - sociology, communications, culture and history, which I believe related all very well to the languages I was studying as well. The modules were also never packed with people, which I liked, as it created a safe space between us and the professors, which in a programme such as languages is essential. The professors always provided extraordinary help, I never felt like I was falling behind in classes, and if I was overwhelmed with the amount of work, they made sure I would contact them in time to get an extension or explain something better and work with me during the stressful time. \n \n\n On top of the module and the professors, I think the campuses across Edinburgh deserve a highlight. There are three main campuses at Edinburgh Napier - the two more central ones being my favourite. The IT campus has a library which is open 24/7, which has saved me countless times during times when I just needed a change in scenery. \n \n\n Overall, I would definitely recommend Edinburgh Napier as a whole. I have met some of the most amazing people at university, and I have never felt so accepted before as an international student. All the people working for the university made such a difference in my studies, which were already amazing due to the well-structured and interesting course I was following. It may not be the same for everyone, since courses vary a lot, but my professors and my course in general has offered me the best 3 years of my life so far. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Firstly, the all inclusive nature of the Merchiston campus meant you encountered people from all walks of life on a day to day basis. Combining that with superb lectures meant that every day was a unique experience regardless of your field of study. Furthermore, my time at university was halved with Covid with teachers and pupils alike having to adjust to more stringent measures. My lectures made each student was accounted and cared for while taking part in our online lessons which is something I greatly appreciated given my more reserved nature. One criticism I would give is the lack of on-campus parking but hey, if you just walk everywhere you&#39;ll be fine!

Rather than doing my exams, it focuses more on practice work that at the same time can be added to the portfolio and makes you have as close to a professional experience as possible.\n \n\n As far as I understand this philosophy is applied to many other programmes which I celebrate because I think practice can be more worthy to get if you aim to get a job in the field you are studying.\n \n\n I perhaps dislike that the library is not 24 hours and is not as big as the Edinburgh University Library and perhaps something else I dislike is that it doesn&#39;t have so many interesting master programmes for me.\n \n\n Would I recommend Napier University? 100% yes if the programme you want is there. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Also, the tutors are very generous to discuss, give instructions, and guide the students to explore the infinity possibility of the design world. Unlike most institutional schools and colleges, this course always encourages students to grow unusual and unique ideas and even experimental concepts.\n\nThe small group class gives the students chances to discuss with the tutors over the semester thoroughly, and tutors are always very kind and patient to us even we want to talk with them in some out of the lecture time. We continued the Zoom course during the unstable political situation in Hong Kong in 2019 and the COVID-19 outbreak since 2020. The critical condition never stops the passion of the tutors; they even give extra time to us to discuss our projects and assignments one by one online. Also, the teaching team and staffs are helpful and always offering us unlimited support during the campus shut down. \n\nFor supporting the project research and the academic article writing, we have the same student account with the material resources and support as the local student in Uop. The arrangement allows us to access most online academic databases from the universities' libraries, research facilities, and organizations. In the meantime, there is also a library on the local campus, the collections about some very particular design topics may be a bit rare, but you can still find extensive collections of many types of other subjects and titles. I think the library is still a very handful for you if your interest is the local culture, the Chinese calligraphy, and all about ancient China's history. Of course, they're still a lot of other books for you all to explore. \n\nThe local Institute is also setting up some workplaces and classrooms for students to work on their project on the campus. You can found that the students who are working there are very friendly, energetic and passionate. The whole campus is joyful and full of fresh sprites with creative talents that always inspire people around.",

These projects allowed me to develop team working skills and built my confidence as well as prompting me to review the work of my peers. \nAnother aspect of the course which I found an incredible success was the study abroad programme. This programme was structured very well and allowed me to study outside of my normal subject area which has proved to be extremely valuable in looking to the future.\nThe career zone has been a supportive department at the university and the continued support after graduation gives me a lot of confidence for a successful career. \nOne aspect of my study experience which didn't work so well was the feedback of my written work. I felt that more attention to my essay after I had written it would have allowed me to develop further as a student. After speaking to academics about my previous essays, I found it difficult to discuss robust frameworks of the marking criteria with them.

          "review": "I was at the University of Exeter as an Erasmus student for one year. I took third year courses in politics. The courses were very interesting, and I particularly enjoyed the culture of active participation at the seminars. Students were asked to talk about the seminar topic in groups, to answer questions in order to get an understanding of the topic, and to debate. This helped get a sense of other people's views and facilitated familiarising with a new topic. The drawback was that sometimes, personal opinions were confused with literature-based positions. The seminars sometimes lacked a scientific approach as there wasn't always a lecture to introduce the topic and create an informed comon debating base.\nThe university facilities are modern and convenient. As a campus-based university, all the buildings are close together. The main library allows you to borrow all the books. There is a small supermarket on campus, as well as take-away food places. Sadly, there is no canteen, which means you'll have to cook a lot by yourself. University accomodations for first year and exchange students are nice although quite expensive (a general problem in Exeter).\nWhat I liked most about the university of Exeter was the huge offer of societies. They cover a diverse range of interests and hobbies, from music to sports over social issues. Societies are a great way to get to know other students with similar interests and to actively engage during your time as a student. This concept doesn't really exist where I come from (Germany), and it seems to be specific to British universities. People are very welcoming and all societies are student-run.\nSomething I didn't like was the term calendar. There are three terms at the university of Exeter: two quite short 11-week classes terms, and one exam term at the end. For politics, this means that the third term is empty (no exams, only essays) and that your studies are basically confined to the time between october and march. You aren't studying the other half of the year. The result is that all essays and coursework are crammed into the 11 weeks of each classes term. This was very stressful; it prevented me from engaging in societies, and it made me skip an essay that I couldn't finish in time. I just wonder why essays cannot be written during the exam term at the end of the year, and generally why the terms are so short and confined to the first half of the year. This is very different (and better imo) in Germany.\nOverall, I was very happy with my Erasmus exchange year in Exeter. It is a great, very dynamic and welcoming university in a lovely town, with interesting courses and a great variety of student activities. I don't regret having chosen Exeter!",

Halfway through the year I was informed that the course was no longer accredited by CIOB and so I had to change my course and complete a HNC for my second year instead. The HNC was an absolute shambles, the first week we had no lecturer and no study material. The second week we were provided a last minute lecturer who advised that the teaching material he had been provided was useless. This lecturer was actually really good and helped the students progress, however, when it came time for another lecturer to deliver the Quantity Surveying portion of the module there was no lecturer provided, for 5 weeks!! We were eventually given one days lecture which apparently covered the previous five weeks missed. I have apparently now completed the course but I am yet to receive any formal acknowledgement of my results. I requested a certificate over a month ago and still have not received it. I am currently on a call to faculty services to chase up my certificate and have been on hold for nearly an hour already. DO NOT go to this University, avoid it like the plague. When I advised the Head Of Faculty about how much of my time had been wasted by the university in traveling an hour each way to find out there were no lecturers available, I was told \"he did not see it as a waste of my time\". This was a part time course, I work full time and study one day a week, I cannot understand how this can not be deemed a waste of my time. Again I urge anyone reading this and thinking about going to Wolverhampton - DO NOT GO!!",

          "review": "As an Asian international student who grew up in the Middle East, it was really nice to study in the UK, where a lot of things are different - the culture, the people, the surroundings, the weather, and the student life. In Qatar where I studied for more than 15 years, the modules and exams were non-stop, even when I entered college. I would only have time to hang out with my family and friends during long holidays or vacation. Well, there aren't many places to go to anyway. However, studying in the UK felt strangely good. Classes would only be done twice a week, and the rest of the days I'm free to do anything, may it be studying by my own or simply rest. I found it beneficial because it was less tiring. Not only that, but I used some of my days working part time and some days visiting other cities. It made me feel productive. With this, I was even more motivated to study hard as I was physically and mentally healthy. It worked well though sometimes when the semester's about to end and exams and deadlines are fast approaching, I would procrastinate so bad. This is due to all subjects' requirements or projects completion period falling on the same month or week. That, for me, would be the disadvantage of having just a little time to spend in classes; asking professors for clarification would be limited. Nevertheless, I enjoyed studying and staying in the UK where I learned many lessons, not just academically but also in the aspect of life in general. I would love to go back and experience this again as I enter my master's degree journey, may it be in the UK or anywhere in Europe.",

In the final year, I have written down a dissertation to find a ventilation solution in an industrial area by using CFD. In every theoretical session, we had an assignment that related to a real-world problem in engineering. As a result of these programs' organizing, we had high problem-solving ability in engineering.

The on campus accommodation was close to supermarkets and offered amazing scenery. What I found to be the biggest challenge, feeling alone, was very quickly diminished as Aston members of staff stayed interactive during online lectures and seminars and offered lots of mental health services and call ups regularly. Post restrictions I was so excited to have a dive into the many facilities. The library was a staple part of my day where I was able to use the computers and print for free. It also gave me a chance to become active again as I brought a membership to the university gym which also has a swimming pool and gave me a chance to join the Islamic society and the cricket club. The student union was a place to meet new people and bond through pool, and listen to music on the speakers and speak in the many booths. The student union offered a prayer space, a halal food court and Astons very own shop to purchase food and drink as well as a starbucks to keep me awake during the day! The main building Is so modern and offers many rooms which can be booked to study and having a person tutor was very helpful when unsure on study and non study related topics. The location of the university is perfect being only a 5 minute walk from Moor Street station and 15 from New street station. The bullring is great for shopping and exploring new cuisines and meeting other students. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Student accommodation is pricey, as they do not have a cheaper option like some universities.

Unless you prefer to do the cheaper option, and live a train ride away in Selly Oak.

Which gives more time fir students to do research and study real life scenarios by their own. Overall the program is a good opportunity for anyone who want to know more about business culture and to become their self a leader in business world.

Similarly, there used to be group projects with which I was able to gain some knowledge of working as a team. Similarly, there used to be a lot of stress during the project works which taught me about time management skills and stress management while working.

It is a great university if you are willing to put lots of extra reading (more than other university) as In class teaching can be a bit more focused on the lower grade students (hence only 4 star). I am really enjoying doing a research proposal as part of my dissertation and feel this degree has really set me up to be a great researcher, which is a good skill for life long learning. The careers and employability service is the best ever, probably why so many of us come put and get jobs straight away. Not only is the course focused on making you academic it's also has a focus of making you employable, along side the careers service there couldn't be any more want for support. All my lecturer's are very good and prominent in their field and the choice of subjects is OK. I have enjoyed nearly every single class for each year and feel very competent in my health knowledge. \n\nThe really bad con is that they take people that don't have many skills in Education and this can be really frustrating at times as people don't read or do homework so the lecturers will go over the work in class, which makes it really boring for people who do the reading. Also now in year 3 London met got a load of people on a top up, it really shows they have no educational background and it's ruining some discussions in my class.

The campus is located right by the river, which is great for reading by or great as a subject for the art students on campus. There are two Costa cafés on campus and one restaurant, one Costa is located in the Reg Vardy building for law, business and tourism building, there are plenty of seats and computers to study on, the other Costa and restaurant is located in the student hub building, the café is attached to a balcony overlooking the restaurant, both of which have great access to the river, and the food provided by the restaurant is hot and delicious. The student hub is an excellent resource for students, staff there can help students with most problems they might face, from technical issues and lost cards to even finding employment, there are also plenty of seats and computers provided there and even booths for a more private studying environment, and if you prefer quiet, you could visit the on campus library. The David Goldman building for technology is an excellent resource available for students, there are multiple lecture rooms with desks equipped with sleek and efficient computers that consume minimal desk space, and also an open plan area full of high spec computers, each with two monitors work faster than you usually can with only one. Overall the university is an incredibly place and a great learning environments, there are multiple benefits for students like helpful staff and the students Union, which aims to make the university a perfect place for students to study with everything available to them, however the university isn&#39;t perfect. Although the university has many benefits available to any student that may need them, it isn&#39;t very helpful at informing the students how to access that information. While you can always ask any lecturer or staff member and they would tell you straight away, this can be nerve-wracking for new students or those with anxiety. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

This also put less added pressure for me as a student when it came to ask questions or be a participant in group work. \n\nSocializing was a bit hard but made easier when I connected with students on online forums from the University student portals and even I decided to create a WhatsApp chat group which a very effective medium for social interaction and inclusivity of other foreign students.

While offering both depth and breadth across this field, these courses put into perspective the importance and relevance of Project Management and Business Administration in Computer Science and the application of its fundamentals to the problems faced by the real world. So, I have realized that learning and developing my knowledge of Business Administration and Project Management, I will have a great contribution to the society since our country is moving towards a computerized and paperless environment hence this will make way for a lot of software development projects, IT management, engineering projects and construction projects which I would like to be a part of.\nI am much eager to adopt and know new technologies. I am enthusiastic to study for a master’s in project management to fully comprehend different Business Administration and Project Management Concepts that are used in Software and engineering Development, because every industry needs the concept of Computer Science, Proper Project Management in Computer Science is a vital component in this regard.",

The course is focused on becoming an independent learner and that is a great skill probably the most important lesson. However, in the course we go through several human diseases but not in depth because is not a medical course therefore students don’t need to learn other than what is taught in lectures well the problem is that when exams come the module leaders expect you to do extra independent learning and add to the information that you have given. I wasn’t totally happy with the final year probest structure and support I think my dissertation worths nothing and made no difference is not like I can publish it anywhere. That’s the main issue with this course they don’t teach you how to become a scientist they teach you how to become a lab worker and they expect you to lear how to perfectly write a paper and how to improve on that yourself. In all years you write lab reports ans essays on a specific disease but the feedback given is useless and sometimes they just comment with a few words for instance “this is not accurate” these type of comments do not help me specifically and are not worth 30k for sure. I was expecting the course to be focused on the students but it seems like the module leaders are more interested on their own research projects than education. The lab practice has not been changed or improved over many years students still do the same things over and over again, it is kinda boring and does not motivate anyone at all. The lab guides need lots of improvement but no ones actually cares to do anything about it. The city itself is pretty bland and quiet nothing to do there the parties are lame and do not worth attending. The seaside is beautiful other than that Sunderland itself was boring.",

The help from staff, especially tutors, was incredible, especially in regard to writing essays. I was new to this type of coursework required in my modules, so I was incredibly grateful to get the help I needed from office hours and email inquiries. One of the concerns I have with St Andrews is the accessibility of student help services. I know multiple students, including myself, who were going through mental health issues or crises during the semester due to coursework. However, meetings with student help services were limited, and they were not able to provide many options to seek help, leaving many students to deal with their issues on their own. One thing I would like to see improved is the resources available for students going through a rough mental period, and clear instructions on how to seek this help. Overall, the academic staff at St. Andrews are incredibly helpful and eager to see you improve, which is my favorite aspect about the school. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "The University of St Andrews, situated in coastal Fife, is a wonderful place to study and live. From vibrant social life to quiet coffee shops and libraries, St Andrews has something for everyone. My favourite thing about St Andrews is the people. This quaint little town is home to lovely, kind locals that are always helpful and welcoming to students. The students themselves are also kind and create a diverse and inclusive community. There are over 150 clubs and societies that are all extremely welcoming and are great ways to make friends and connect with like-minded people and you are sure to find something new that you will love. University definitely wouldn’t have been as good an experience if I had gone somewhere other than here. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I would only recommend this university for those who are highly driven and studious, but also want to have a good time. \n For humanities students, there is a constant stream of readings and essays that need to be completed. If you stay on top of these, the student can easily enjoy the social side of the university. There are so many societies and clubs to join, with interests that range far and wide. \n I studied Art History as my main subject, and completed modules in Classical Studies, Management, Divinity, and Film Studies across my first two years. All courses demanded a lot, and at the time I wish I had attended a different university where I could focus on one thing. But looking back, I am grateful for my learning experience, as those subjects ended up making me a well-rounded student with more academic experience than my peers at other universities. \n The best thing was the town, there isn&#39;t a place like it. I think the calm, university town cultivates studying. St Andrews isn&#39;t well connected to cities, and so on the slower days, studying is all you can do. Students make their own fun, and you really have to be willing to put in the effort to get the most out of the university and its community. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "The highlight of my time at the University of St Andrews is the culture of seeking enchantment that students create. Most students make friends outside their study program, and I love how discussions between friends very frequently center on what they learn in their respective classes. Most people in the town really value insights you can get from talking with people different from you, which results in an openness to a variety of experiences. Additionally, there is a culture of aestheticizing knowledge and the process of obtaining it; because of this, many students find it easy to be passionate about their degree. The norm of in-depth discussions contributed to feeling that I have undergone a lot of personality growth. Finally, lectures and seminars are well organized and the staff is very respectful and friendly. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "At sub-honours, the university&#39;s module system feels very flexible, as students can choose modules from subjects that are not part of their degree title. However, at honours, the selection of modules available within your subject(s) changes each year. Some years are better than others. Additionally, the addition of a dissertation in your final year makes it much harder to choose modules you are actually interested in. Even with the option to not do a dissertation (an option available to joint-honours students), the student&#39;s choices will still be restricted, as they need to do a year-long module rather than 2 semester-long modules. It becomes rather restrictive. No matter what module you choose, however, the teacher of that module will be extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their subject and, although you may not find it the most interesting, you still appreciate the passion that they feel for it. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "St Andrews. The home of golf and the oldest university in the UK, St Andrews is what meets the eye and so much more. It deeply pains me that despite the Guardian the rating St Andrews the best University in the UK above Oxford and Cambridge two years in a row, few outside of Scotland whom I have spoken to have heard of UofA.\n\nFor me, studying in a small, historical, costal university town of St Andrews was an amazing experience. For me, the location of studying in a small costal university town was perfect for me because of the close-knit community atmosphere. Attending early morning lectures on marine ecology in the Oceans Institute with glorious views of the crashing waves of the North sea speckled with early-rise surfers was truly memorable. Overall, the abundance and variety of societies was excellent, from surfing to quidditch. Best of all was the age old traditions such as battle-scale foam fights and running into the North sea at sunrise on the first day of every May in order to &#39;cleanse your academic sins&#39; (to name but a few)! St Andrews also has a large number of international students which allowed me to meet a lot of interesting people from all over the world. I made friends for life!\n\nMy experience of my Biology degree here was really great. The lecturers were all interesting. Most of them were all actively engaged in scientific research at the forefront of their subject specialism. All were friendly and approachable. We had a great week long field course on costal ecology for Biology students in our final year.\n\nOne issue with St Andrews was shortages in accommodation. that accommodation was like gold-dust; rare, highly sought after, expensive and \nextremely exhausting to obtain. University accommodation was well run but there was a lack of space to accommodate students from low income households. Additionally, the shortage of student accommodation was a real problem in 2022. In my final year around 200 students were forced to find accommodation outside of St Andrews due to the university taking on a higher volume of students than usual. St Andrews is also expensive unless you are prepared to walk further to buy your groceries - it is a well known fact that the Tesco in the centre St Andrews is the the most expensive in the Scotland.\n\nAll in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend the university highly to any who wish to study in a historic a friendly part of Scotland with quality teaching experiences.",

Although it is of-course a subjective endeavour it is also a craft that one must learn. I myself felt at the end of the course that I was a much stronger writer however I still feel that I have a long way to go before I am 'good.' And one criticism I do have is that it was advertised that this course would involve 'outside input, from guest lecturers and industry professionals often leading to industry experience and even internship.'

The quality of teaching is great and the feedback you get from your module tutors, lecturers and personal tutors is also fantastic. There is a great student service if you are ever in need of help or advice. I believe it was a struggle to figure out how to provide quality education after the pandemic hit and as a student, personally, I struggled with online lectures and seminars which did affect my grading, however, my teachers were always there to give advice. Email responses are actually better now in my opinion. Overall, I've really enjoyed my time at Birkbeck, it's a different experience from a conventional university however I think it makes you work harder and you learn so much more. In a typical university, you're in classes with 18 to 24 year old who share similar life experiences with you however at Birkbeck you're in classes with 18 to 60-year-olds. You make friends with people who you normally would pass by and you learn from them. In my opinion it's much more rewarding.",

One unique aspect of the university is the creative freedom and cross-disciplinary collaboration that is encouraged, which has allowed me to take advantage of a variety of facilities such as the photography studio, film studio, and printmaking and laser cutting equipment. These resources have provided me with the ability to bring even the most ambitious project ideas to fruition. The wide range of facilities and support for creative exploration at Kingston University has been a valuable asset in my academic and personal development. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

You will find people of all backgrounds here everyone is equal. Not much to say about the things I didn&#39;t like but I felt that since I was a media student we required to be in art building more than science building and I felt having to travel back and forth between them. Which wasn&#39;t so bad since the art campus and science campus are at walking distance of 5 minutes. It would have been nice to have it available in campus where we were mainly based for lecturers and seminars. Other than that amazing university, awesome time spent with friends and teachers here.

The time I got the disability dept plan of action Jan/Feb (5/6 months later on a 9-month course, By Jan I had already left)\n\nThe university did well with the teaching in-person (Sept/Oct 2020), however online teaching with teams caused problems, logging in issues - access, and rejected from classes (Uni claimed to be technical issues).\n\nI'm a mature student with a decade+ of working in civil service management and a few other sectors with a degree, master's and an attempt at PhD. I have dyslexia - require extra time for planning lessons, seeing plans and lecture notes slightly in advance. Both university and school placement failed to do this. \n\nPGCE Primary lesson plans were required a minimum of 2 days before the lesson. However, I would always get the lesson schedule and topics from the teacher on a Sunday afternoon, meaning that Mondays and Tuesdays lessons were never in \"on time\" - always flagged up on the weekly meetings but used against me on the Thursday meetings!\nUniversity felt that it was resolved if I didn't plan Monday's lessons - so what about Tuesday then?? Even if I didn't have a disability this was a shambles.\n\nLibrary constantly closed. From online tuition no reflection with peers to discuss issues or ideas.\n\nFor £9250+ tuition. I felt this was very poor value for money.\n\nAdvice - plan your studies and where you want to go. Get your disability and requirements sorted months in advance i.e. requirement of needs report month(s) before starting. Uni will pay for one but, does take considerable time to arrive.\n\nThe biggest perk for (usually mature) students is they have a multi-storey car park at their Kingston Hill Campus",

My study experience has been supported from the start with academic help from the library resources, tutor meetings and workshops. This didn't take away my independent studies or work rate but encouraged me to research more into my studies. My study experience at Kingston wasn't always as easy due to being unaware of having dyslexia until last year. This was severely difficult for me as it took me a lot longer to take information in and understand it. I struggled a lot in terms of losing valuable marks for mistakes such as spelling so academic tasks such as essays were no good. However with the help of my lecturers I have now found a study technique that works best for me and my memory as well as regular talks with peers whom also have dyslexia. My grades have now gone from scraping 40% for the academic year to finishing my second year with a high 2:1 (69%)!",

But others basically just read off of the presentation slides and didn&#39;t explain what they required of you properly. It was definitely a lot of self teaching. My accommodation was standard but the food was good and they had 3 options every night for dinner. I must say though the mental health resources could be better as I know a lot of my friends and other people complained about them. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Doing this pointed me in the direction of some of bristol&#39;s great resources such as access to Future Learn and the Career&#39;s Service employment site where I was able to find multiped internship and work opportunites. I really rated this about the uni and used it a lot throughout my 3 years there. \n I studied english and personally found the course content really enjoyable. I was able to study what I wanted and really thrived from the content and work we were given. \n Even despite covid closures, the libraries I used at bristol were always accessible and supported my studies. \n I don&#39;t have any experience of living in halls but bristol is generally a great, accessible and enjoyable city and uni for students which I would recommend. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I have met amazing, like-minded people and had the opportunity to study abroad which has been the best year of my life. That said, it did serve to highlight the potholes in the English University system. Considering the incredibly high cost for education, I struggle to see where the money has gone. Contact hours are few and lecturers are hostile. Attendance isn't mandatory so around a third of students never attend. Participation isn't graded so when they do attend they have rarely done the required work. The lack of regular assessment and guidance makes the prospect of writing a dissertation terrifying. People often say University is what you make of it, but sometimes it's out of your control.",

I have arrived at UK with a little amount of money and urgently started to seek a part time job.\n\nThere were many barriers such as language and visa limitations. However, I managed to find a part time role in a warehouse. I was leaving my dormitory 4 am, working in the warehouse without sitting. Then, I was attending lectures without resting. I have spent many nights awake to submit my assignments.\n\nOne day, the warehouse stopped calling. However, this time, I found a position in a design office.\n\nIt was miraculous but they were looking for someone just like me. It was a small office with less than 10 people and with a brave director. The director was investing on the technology that I was studying to learn. I knew that I had to make his investment successful, to hold my role. Therefore, I made a hard work.\n\nLater, the UK hit by the pandemic. My employer was happy with my performance and they trusted me to work from home. Meanwhile, everyone has left the accomodation, but I wanted to stay to focus. My employer and I have managed to keep our trust for each other. After the pandemic, I have been offered a permanent role and my employer wanted to sponsor my Skilled Worker visa.\n\nI graduated, but didn't want to leave that small enterprise as only they were appreciating my approach. Out of this office, everyone was talking about being out of the box and etc. However, only they were really understanding what does it mean.\n\nUnfortunately, the company recently decided to end all its services due to the conflicts with the partners abroad. I got unemployed. On the other hand, I have already renewed my 10 years old laptop and broken phone. Now I am more confident than I used to be. My employer, my former lecturers and also my mates are still supporting me by giving advices.\n\nNowadays, I seek for a new role, and to be honest, it is very difficult to find a sponsor, if you are an architect.\n\nI will be leaving soon, if I cannot get an opportunity. However, the UK gave me the greatest story that I have ever had. I do feel very lucky for having a chance to prove my skills. Regardless of whether I will be able to find a role again, as a skilled worker, I do already feel proud of myself. And that's something invaluable.\n\nThat was my story during \"the year\", squeezed between the lines of the story of the world in 2020. Thanks for reading. \n\nBest wishes... \n\nGoker",

Over the last three years of my degree I have made lifelong friends, developed new skills and developed more as a person than I ever thought I would. The university has so many different societies and clubs to get involved with during your studies there. In particular, the Help the Homeless society which I found myself being co-president and secretary of within the last few years. Being part of the society has allowed me to contribute giving back to the local community and working with local charities. I also have had the opportunity to practice public speaking, working with others and collaborating with other societies and communicating with the Guild of students. The university feels more like a second home and the familiarity feeling of the campus contributes to this. From uni accommodation to living with some of my closest friends, I could not have chosen a better university for my degree.",

There is also a high street not too far from the university as well and can be accessed but almost any of the buses that come to the Uni. In my course (computer science) the teaching as a whole has been good with there being lectures where you are taught theoretical knowledge and labs where you either apply what you have been taught in the lecture to practicality or taught something else. The campus is quite big and always full of people throughout the day but this oftens leads to a lot of overcrowding at the same time. Finally, the classrooms are nothing to write home about they are pretty standard, but the labs are quite good and as long as you are studying a stem subject you will get the to end experience in the labs. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Having the university building spread out does have its cons though as it makes it slightly more difficult to find where classes or meeting point are, especially if it is your first year; thankfully, the university provides an app/website called WayFinder that allows the user to type in a class of building name and then will give them directions to get there. As Coventry can be considered a &#39;cozy&#39; place compared to big cities like Birmingham or London, for me, it is the perfect place to start off a new stage in your life and don&#39;t want to get overwhelmed with the location change. For students like me who came from outside of England, being part of Coventry University helped make this scary change run a lot smoother, from the faculty to the students - they are always there looking out for you when you need them to be. The university also offer various societies for students to apply to with free taster sessions throughout the year, each society hold social events so the members are able to interact not only during society times but also outside to get to know everyone else on a more friendlier level. The societies however do have fees which could vary each year depending on how many members have decided to participate also if your club competes during tournaments, there could be additional charges.\nOverall, my time so far at Coventry University has been amazing even with the ups and downs, meeting different kinds of people from my society and from university accommodation that several I am living with now in my second year and probably will be living with until I graduate. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

If you as a student is willing to go the extra mile, as will your lecturer, I’ve personally been able to schedule so many Teams meetings that fall out of sociable hours, to discuss my coursework and general well-being and I have felt supported every time.\n \n\n With Covid-19 finally having less of an effect on on-campus learning, seminars and lectures are much more intimate, engaging and interactive. There are frequent social meetups (with unlimited free food!) hosted to give students and staff a chance to speak and discuss almost anything within reason. This is just one of many examples that highlights the importance the university places on building a community within the small city of Coventry, rather than treating it as just business.\n \n\n Since starting my final year, I have been able to collect over 5 qualifications, without even graduating yet - from language, to certifications in skills that are commonly required within the working industry of Marketing.\n \n\n There are so many things I could talk about Coventry University, if you’d like to know more, feel free to drop me a question or if you’re feeling daring enrol and find out for yourself! <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

As an international student, I found comfort in this and finding friends was easy, especially after joining their amazing sports clubs. The sports culture and atmosphere were a great way of socialising and networking with other students, having fun and supporting each other through university. Despite the rough times in 2020 during the COVID pandemic, the university staff worked hard to keep things as normal as possible, considering the global change in work/study style. At times, the organisation level wasn&#39;t at its best, but the university was open to hearing students&#39; feedback to improve. \n Three years later, I graduated from Coventry University with the best memories in my life and friendships that will last forever thanks to the wide community the university has. Nevertheless, the support from tutors and lecturers was outstanding whenever I needed help and the knowledge I have gained from them will be with me always. \n Coventry University - amazing experience, high-level of education, great students union exoerience. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

It is apparent that this institution is primarily a profit-machine, and secondly a university. This is due to the shows of nepotism that have been shown. For instance, I had a lecturer - the best-rated lecturer in the course - who flagged 3 students for plagiarism (something the university says takes very seriously). Problem was, the students were wealthy and their families were notorious patrons of the university. For this reason, the institution issues a suspension onto that lecturer, who, quite literally, only did his job. It became unbearable so the lecturer had to quit. Therefore, I highly discourage any individual to attend this university. Save your 27500£. It's not worth it.",

However due to lack of competition and bit less exposure compared to the other international institutions, I felt I got to taste medium potential of what the course could offer. \n\nSo, to summarize best part was the dynamic syllabus it self that carried timely competitive topics to cover and guidelines set by university upon the institution which ensured the learning and implementing experience.

While a lovely scenic campus and an extensive library with 12 floors it still lacks in communication. This is one of the few things which I believe is a flaw with this university. When you email a member of staff for help or a query you are typically left waiting days and days until you receive a reply, by which point you have had to sort it out yourself or the problem has grown. I also think that feedback on work is sometimes lacking. I would appreciate more feedback on a piece of work on what I can improve and what I should continue to do but usually it is just generic feedback for the full class. Despite these small flaws, the university earns its prestigious title with their challenging classes and engaging tutorials where you can really delve into a topic and explore it from all angles.

When it comes to music, I must admit that we didn&#39;t receive the finest support. Surprisingly, this turned out to be beneficial since it forced us to pave our own paths and engage in self-discovery while figuring things out and learning. We lacked professional-led orchestras or ensembles, proper guidance, practical skills classes (which are typically expected in a music program), and limited exposure to the public. However, these circumstances provided me with the opportunity to explore on my own, push my limits, and truly uncover what I desired from my musical journey while determining the most effective approach for my personal growth.",

Development Finance at the University of Ghana broadened and deepened my understanding into the realities and insight of the global markets and players, international financing, national economic development and sustainable and responsive investment. The study enabled me to appropriately connect possible remedies to varied degrees of economic and technological problems (gaps) created as a result of a combination of factors; some dysfunctional systems and structures in the African economy precisely Ghana and the global economy at large. A top notch delivery by seasoned lecturers exposed me to avenues of financing that could typically ensure sustainability of international trade and businesses as well as the local economy where fintech is making giant strides in harnessing the fortunes of the economy for development, and this also gave rise to financial inclusion. Notably, sessions with renowned industry players and experts in related fields afforded me a hands on guide and lead into a achieving a comprehensive and holistic package of learning experience. However, it would have been extra superb if some practical industrial tours and study visits (both internationally and locally) to a few multinational and other key organisations of study were fused in the schedule for such interesting and rich programme.

Ukraine is a relatively small country with a population of about 41 million. Every year, more than 160.000 Ukrainians get to know about the presence of cancer, of which almost 9.000 suffer from brain and spinal cord cancer (almost 6 % of the total incidence). Therefore, every 16th patient with detected cancer has a brain or spinal cord cancer. Of these - every 5th ( 30 % ) can not be operated on and undergo chemo and radiotherapy due to the lack of a specialist, because in Ukraine they are limited, in particular in the neurooncological realm. The knowledge about this problem in Ukraine is out-dated as we live in a Post-Soviet Union area.After the completion of the course I hope to become the consultant neurosurgeon dealing with a wide spectrum of oncological pathology using the knowledge obtained from the University of Glasgow and help people to get the proper treatment according to the world's standards.

          "review": "The overall study experience at the University of Glasgow was incredible. For a student that was interested in mostly colonial and imperial history, I was able, in my last two years, to take a variety of subjects that covered all of my area of interests from the discovery of America, to the East India Company, and even the society and politics of the crusader states. The resources available to students both in the library as well as online gave us a huge database to work off of, and allowed for all of us in seminars to bring up pieces that were perhaps outside of the reading, as well as adding additional perspectives to discussion. \n\nMy favorite part of studying at Glasgow was definitely writing my dissertation. Whilst we had to go for an original idea, we were otherwise given complete freedom in our choice of topic, and with the University of Glasgow's wealth of professors, almost any field of interest, most students were able to find the advisor for them with ease and write on topics they were passionate about. I wrote my dissertation on the diplomacy of Otto von Bismarck during his time as German Chancellor, and with my excellent advisor Dr Peacock, I was able to write a piece that I both felt confident in and genuinely enjoyed putting together. The excellent database of sources here at Glasgow only added to what I could write about, and there were few students that were unable to write on their preferred topic due to a lack of sources.\n\nIf there was one flaw in my experience of studying at Glasgow it was in the way that information was conveyed in one hour lectures and seminars. It was not until fourth year that we got a different style of teaching, in which classes were a one hour lecture and two hour seminar put together. Personally, I found this to be a far more motivational and effective teaching method for several reasons. Firstly, it was more engaging due to the smaller class sizes, and allowed more active discussion within a much larger time frame. Secondly, the course was structured so that most classes were at least mostly student lead, encouraging independent research in the students. That being said, the size of the classes in first and second year would have made such an approach unsuitable, and the lectures were still informative and engaging in most circumstances.",

Moreover, all professors I have had have always been willing to help with any content of a subject I struggled with and have also always treated me with respect. However, I think that this University is quite focused on preparing their students for research paths so if you do not like reading and analyzing academic papers and models there might be more suitable choices elsewhere. \n\nBut if you don't mind this, then I definitely recommend this place! The slogan of this University is \"World Changers Welcome\" and they make everything they can to help you become one. You will have a chance to choose from around 100 societies and clubs to join so whatever your hobbies are, you will find like-minded people here that will happily take you to be a member of their community and will help you improve in your talents such as sports of academic disciplines or just explore your hobbies more - we even have a society for people who like to watch Disney movies together ;). Apart from this, the University offers an incredible amount of events on campus, ranging from forums and debates with notable individuals from outside of our University to career days during which you can meet and chat with employers you dream to work with one day. \n\nA word of advice: Student accommodation can be quite pricy and private flats are cheaper, however, make sure the flat is of decent quality. Ideally, prefer flats other than old basement ones since unfortunately it is quite common to then have to deal with mice in such flats. Also, if you fear a flat advert might be a scam, talk to Student Services at the University before signing any contract. They will be able to advise you. \n\nFinally, enjoy your time at this world-class university and make the most of your free time especially in the first three years, since in the fourth year you will most probably spend your days in a library working on your dissertation as I do now... :D \n\nGood luck on your journey :)",

          "review": "I enjoyed my master's degree in Data Analytics (School of Mathematics & Statistics) massively and I can confidently say I have never learned more in 12 months, but warning it is extremely intense and an immense challenge academically. \n\nThe curriculum was significantly more up to date than as comparable European institutions and my subject area went into great levels of detail, always at the forefront of contemporary research. Our professors were high-class researchers with an international reputation and this is reflected very positively in the curriculum, which can adapt to the newest findings swiftly, changing possibly on a year-to-year basis (an advantage over most other EU systems). \n\nWith greater academic quality, comes also a much higher workload throughout the 3 semesters. Holiday semesters as we know it in mainland Europe do not exist (besides of 2 weeks Christmas break) and aside from larger lecture material (often exceeding 500 pages), there are several assignments to complete alongside all other study commitments. These assignments usually count somewhere between 10% and 30% (mostly 20%) to your final mark, with 70-90% weighted for the usually 120 minutes final examination for each module. \n\nThe exams itself are very demanding and the time pressure is significant, however, if you study throughout the semester and do all your coursework and assignments it should not represent an issue for passing them with an acceptable grade. If one wishes to obtain top grades (A to B) however, you should study and read about 12 to 15 hours every day. \n\nDespite being \"only\" one year in length you will cover about 12 to 13 modules + a final Dissertation in this time, which will amount to 180 UK credits or 90 ECTS, whereas in Europe you would only have earned 60 ECTS in the same time. Additionally, you will be expected to be more independent in conducting your research up to a point where you implement and cary out your own simulations and model evaluations based on several different algorithms. It is really a stimulating academic experience, I valued it enormously and I am convinced this institution has given me a significant edge when being competitively trained for top PhD programmes in the future. \n\nMy recommendation is to make sure you study something mathematically-computer sciency only if your bring the academic passion and you love working on independent research including computer programming languages like R, Python and SAS Analytics. I do, however, NOT recommend it for people just polishing their CV for industry, for this you could obtain an easier and more relaxed 2-year European master's and save some stress and time pressure. But I can assure everyone the education is world-class, at least in the area of Data Analytics. The modules I covered included;\n\n1) Artificial Intelligence\n2) Machine Learning\n3) Big Data Analytics\n4) Data Analysis\n5) R Programming\n6) Analytics with SAS\n7) Bayesian Statistics\n8) Statistical Inference\n9) Time Series\n10) Generalized Linear Models\n11) Regression Models\n12) Probability\n13) Academic Writing Skills\n\nI hope this review is informative and helps people to make a sound decision when choosing Glasgow University.",

          "review": "The University of Glasgow has a big reputation so I chose to study there. Unfortunately, the School of Engineering is poor and I didn't really get any specialization. Considering that I had to choose 6 courses, where the 3 of the compulsory were about the same subject (which was only theory) I was disappointed. Plus, I expected in a MSc program to be only MSc students, which want to widen our knowledge and skills however, 4 of the 6 classes were filled with 200 undergraduate students and 10 Master students. Furthemore, when a MSc student pays 8,000 GBP for studies, he expect the tutors to teach him/her and help as more as possible, which unfortunately didn't happen. Since the Induction their words were \"You are MSc students, you study yourself, we don't teach you\" and that was true! When me or someone else asked a question about something new the answer was \"Google it!\". I am sorry but if I have to Google to learn why do I pay 8,000 GPB for tuition fees? Last but not least, in the beginning I thought I just chose the wrong subject. BUT I met a student of Industrial Design in one common course, who told me that in the whole MSc he only had 1 designing course out of 7 and it was very poor, he learned nothing that he didn't already know. So now, I am looking to study Design in the capital of Designers, Italy.",

Young people should be trained to take over the mantle of handling our world’s issues and HEIs are the best and most convenient way to teach SDGs. I believe Canadian Universities still have a long way to go in championing the SDGs, but it’s initial steps are amazing as seeing YorkU assist changemakers such as creating an AI for water assessment in refugee camps or giving people the opportunity to serve vulnerable populations like indigenous tribes. I believe my platform as a student ambassador can help universities all over the world commit to the SDGs.

I can not do something about it now but what I feel like I’m obliged to do is to at-least inform prospective students, so they would know what should they expect. In general, I feel like it isn’t a master level program at all, they just don’t teach you anything at masters level, the only decent content in this course are 2 modules about digital design and again even for that I think the material could have been more advanced. But that’s it the rest of modules are just like an after thought. Oh btw, did I said that Most of students are international student from a particular country who can’t even communicate in English and barely has any background knowledge in their discipline? It just felt so isolating for me from the beginning of the course because of that. IMO, the whole program revolves around getting sweet tuition fees from oversea students and lowering the bar enough to give them a degree. It’s what this program is designed for. For most of the course they just don’t want to really educate you, they just give you the shallow bare minimum information about the subject. The content of modules are also pretty low effort.\nI’m still at the middle of this course right now, I have had most of “taught” modules, I hope I could write a comprehensive review about it and go through the details for each modules to truly enlighten you about how things are. Some modules are absolutely farce and I couldn’t believe myself having such ridiculous lectures.\n My only advice is, if you’re a good student and look for a decent education, don’t mistake this course as a decent one, dont make my mistake, dont be fooled by all of those rankings and russel group gospel, try to choose a better program if you’re really after a good master degree in this field. This program is most probably more useful for people who don’t have any background in this field. They can learn the basics.\nOn the other hand if you do have background in this field and just want to get an degree for it to find a relevant job after graduation, it “may” not be a disappointing choice of school in that regard. I’m still not sure about it tho, as I haven’t been graduated yet. \nI hope this review has been useful for you, I couldn’t find any reviews for this course when I was choosing it and didn’t have any knowledge about all this, I hope Ive changed this for you.",

Your track can also be changed during the first year as it's the same for all of the economics courses and all but one of the courses in 2nd year can be taken by students taking the 'Economics' track, so if you're unsure if it's the right course for you, you can always change a little bit.

The office hours the staff members offered were indispensable during my degree, especially when pretty much 95% of my final year was spent remotely due to the pandemic. The course was structured well, offering everyone a chance to dabble in various literary genres and periods before discovering and specialising on what they were interested in and wanted to pursue further. It gave me good foundational knowledge in literary periods from the medieval to the contemporary, and while studying this degree I found an unexpected love for medieval literature, when I first started at York expected to gravitate towards the contemporary. The ability to create your own essay titles and write about topics you're interested in was admittedly daunting at first, especially since in A-Levels you would be given set questions, but this ended up being really exciting and became beneficial when it came to coming up with dissertation topics. There was freedom, depth and breadth all throughout the course, and while there were undoubtedly ups and downs, with regards to academics, I enjoyed my time at York. \n\nIf I were to name one negative with regards to the course, it's the Anglocentric nature of some of the modules. While there was a huge variety of modules we could take, and the diversity of the reading lists has improved over the course of my three years, it would be nice to have more BIPOC academics or BIPOC authors featured, as opposed to only having one or two famous ones.

The challenges set out in the Foundation in Legal Skills module are very thoughtful, which can stimulate students' thoughts in thinking about solving conflicts among different parties in negotiation. The marking criteria is generally well explained - lecturers tend to explain the task in different ways and in a couple of plenaries to let students know about how to deal with the tasks. However, the study experience could have been improved by providing a better channel in giving out information. New updates are sometimes announced on VLE but sometimes through emails to all.

More can also be done for international Master students looking to stay in the UK with the new Graduate route.",

York is an incredibly wonderful and peaceful city. There are so many ducks, geese, etc., on campus, and I often go there to feed birds and go on a walk with my friends. As an international student, I enjoyed the whole experience of university life, including living in school accommodation(Halifax colleges), and getting a job on campus. I've made many friends by taking part in social clubs, including UYKCS(Korean Cultural Society) and YUPE (University of York Pole dance Exercise). It has been difficult during the pandemic. However, I literally enjoyed my second year a lot as I got to choose the modules (Neuroscience, Immunology & Infection, and so on) that I was really interested in. The academic staff is so supportive, friendly, and approachable -they always listen to our needs, thoughts, and ideas and try their best to make the best they could to help us, so I'm very grateful! As much as I have enjoyed the previous year, there are so many more things to look forward to as the third year, and I can't wait for September to come back around.",

It is a 10 minute walk from the campus to the sea and a short drive to Dartmoor National Park which is stunning. It is also right next to cornwall which has great towns and beaches to explore. I felt like the University definetly puts a lot of effort into engaging all students in other aspects of university life and not just the degree. This includes societies, career help, mental health advice and socialising. I had a great deal of support whenever I reached out to these different areas. The only issues I found with the University in some cases was the lack of communication. Especially during COVID when students has questions that needed to be answered we would sometimes be left in radio silence. This was particularly for my course however some other faculties had better communication. I understand that COVID was a bad time for all universities but I felt especially unsupported by my lectureres during this time. We missed out on a great deal of class time, field trips abroad and practical lesson which were never made up for. Instead we were continually told that they could do nothing at all about our loss of learning and our fees were still to be paid. Overall, Plymouth is a great location and I believe that if it had not been for COVID my time at Plymouth would have been most enjoyable. I would like to also highlight how great the career services are and how many opportunites they had to help me gain access to more than just my degree. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The subject matter in the course was very useful in field of work and the lecturers who taught us were super friendly and they are professionals in the area of marketing management. For past few years I've gained more knowledge about business and marketing management and it was a great Lifetime experience I wish I could get before.",

In fact, I was able to gain experience in my area of interest, by doing fieldwork and being able to go on field trips throughout the years. In addition, I am also able to manage my studies while working (part-time job). I came to Plymouth in 2019, I was 17 at the time. It was the first time I was by myself and had to do everything by myself, from the basic - cooking, cleaning, or grocery shopping - to more difficult aspects such as applying for a National Insurance Number, opening a bank account, or dealing with the Brexit stress. However, I believe that the University staff has always been very helpful and accessible, and so I would recommend this experience to any student!",

The lecturers were on the whole very friendly and accommodating to queries. This programme is very well rounded with a good amount of contact time as well as interesting fieldwork opportunities.\nLectures are engaging and cover a broad range of topics and the school's petrology and computer labs are well equipped. In terms of other university facilities, the library contains materials covering every facet of the course and then some. The library also contains ample computer and work space and is open 24/7.\nAlthough Plymouth is in a bit of a backwater, the university stands out as a unique mix of campus and city life with the city centre, student accommodation and sporting/society facilities only a walk away. There are various bars/cafes nearby as well as non-university managed student accommodation areas (its possible to rent for under £100 per week).\nThere are plenty of friendly clubs and societies and trying a new sport or activity is really easy. Personally, I highly recommend joining a few in first year and there are clubs and societies fairs twice annually and its a great chance to engage with these activities.\nThe campus was clean and easy to navigate. I felt safe on campus and in the student village.\nI switched course in order to pursue a masters level qualification whilst receiving undergrad funding. I also had the opportunity to study planetary geology as part of this. I was more than happy to remain in Plymouth and at this university.",

Some students say that there isn&#39;t much to do in the neighbourhood in terms of entertainment options like shopping or movies, but I&#39;d counter that there are a tonne of magnificent locations to explore if you like hiking and sightseeing. For me personally, the student support has been outstanding. My academic success has been facilitated by their patience and understanding with my difficulties. Every week, the university hosts several programmes and sporting events. In particular, the accommodation options offered by the university are quite affordable when compared to other accommodations. \nI will highly recommend Bangor University to those who want to get out of a busy and crowded city. It’s a great place to relax and study peacefully. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I was able to make connections with different researchers and organizations in the field of conservation science for future research consortiums. Bangor university is ambient and favorable for graduate studies with relevant and skilling modules that not only enhance knowledge and skills development but also make a way for career definition. Studying at Bangor university gave me the opportunity to carry out research on one of Africa's valuable medicinal plants which is the African ginger (Mondia whitei). From this research, I was able to make recommendations for its sustainable utilization and management which recommendations I can follow through Ph.D. studies to bring to life the Sustainable Millennium development goals of improving livelihoods and sustainable utilization of our natural resources. The experience at Bangor has readied me for my next chapter in plant conservation and sustainable management and development of natural resources while improving the livelihoods of the rural people in Uganda.",

There are a lot of uphill and downhills, which can make walking exhausting but that should not discourage you. Everything is within walking distance, therefore there is no need for public transport within the city. Only if you are student at the School of Ocean Sciences you might need to take the bus, but consider getting a bike. It is a good exercise and much cheaper.

They provided many resources to help me with my studies. \n \n\n The lecturers were really supportive and accommodating. If I required an extension or needed extra help, they were more than happy to provide it. The courses and modules were very informative, and provided great learning opportunities. Assignments were explained in detail. I felt I was given sufficient time and support, in meeting deadlines and completing assignments. I also studied during the pandemic, which the university handled amazingly; hand sanitiser stations, masks and social distancing were implemented effectively. Online learning was brought in to further accommodate learning, in the difficult times. \n \n\n After my first year I changed course, which ended up being extremely easy and stress free. The university supported me in this decision and guided me through the process. I also found the societies and social aspects of Bangor University, to be really diverse and interesting. \n \n\n Overall a great experience, both from an educational and social stand point.

Especially with lockdown rules forbbiding to move back and the university forcing us to come back last year but then turns out we had only online classes for the whole year... this has put a lot of us in a precarious situation finantially because we could have just gone home and waited it out but still study, but they waited until way into october to finally release the schedules after months of telling us of that famous 'blanded format' and there was absolutely no reason at all to be in the UK at the time)\n\nHopefully i manage to finish this year and graduate, obviously i hope my next semester has more face to face classes and that overall it become a good memory.\n\nI truly hope this year we get a graduation ceremony, though (given they cancelled the last 2, and personally it feels like it's one of the highlights of studying in the UK)",

Each module is clear and well organised - this definitely helps in first year when it can be easy to feel overwhelmed with the new workload. It’s very easy to find your way around due to it being a campus university as everything is in close proximity. I lived at Greenbank accommodation in my first year and the staff are so helpful and make you feel very well settled. There is a huge community feel and the modules are interactive meaning making friends is much easier and a lot less intimidating.

None-the-less, I feeI compelled to enlarge my understanding and maintain my grades. \n\nI have joined various societies and clubs, and enjoy the aspects of cultural diversity. \nThis for me is part of the enriching experience of campus life, which I miss. Prior to joining SOAS University of London, I enjoyed my boarding house experience at Charterhouse, Surrey UK, where I completed my IB Diploma. As Deputy of House, I was active among the student body. I look forward to the start of my second year in September/October 2021, when we will return to campus. \n\nThis time away from physical presence at university has compelled me to be more organized and to have a routine. I take full advantage of the four hour time difference. I am an early riser and sportsman and daily maintain a rigorous 3 hours tennis routine. I also have taken on part time assignment framing and making corporate presentations a great learning for me.

Courses taught across the Development and Economics departments, in my experience, provide students with a curriculum inclusive of hetrodox and orthodox dimensions, which are presented and critiqued within historical context. Students have the opportunity to diversify in their theoretical understanding and question mainstream paradigms through exploration of such discourses. Programmes can be tailored to individual interests by enrolling and auditing open modules offered by different departments, supporting interdisciplinary reasoning. Furthermore, SOAS’s efforts to decolonise their curriculum through an active campaign to include non-western view points demonstrates the school’s endeavour for inclusive pedagogy.\n\nThe student community and teaching body at SOAS represents social diversity. Race, ethnicity, language, gender, ability and religion and spirituality are reflected. Through classes and extracurricular activities such as conferences, lecture series and societies, SOASs creates an environment for networking and engaging with a diverse range of perspectives shaped by equally diverse experiences and backgrounds. I believe greater intra-student discussion can be had within classes and tutorials to maximise communication and debate but otherwise teaching, courses and academic student life has been fantastic.",

The University believes in allowing students to explore as many things as they wish by promoting fairs and Expos all around the campus so students of all disciplines can attend. As a Business School student, my favourite thing about it is the hands-on student development team which is always there for a chat, guidance or support. The innovation and opportunities are endless. However, I wish academically, there was more exam support. Due to Covid, many formats have changed so current students cannot always depend on the past-papers. Many people wish the lecturers could practice exam style questions or give us a sample paper so that we could be familiar with the format or the way questions are formatted. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

However, I&#39;d say it almost resembles a piece of art that looks stunning from far away but gets uglier the closer you get to it. Upon close examination, UoE severely lacks student support whether it be student mental health concerns or simply attempting to contact a course organiser or tutor. It also tends to offer courses as electives for students that at first glance seem to be of high quality and useful, but they&#39;re organised by professors who think too highly of themselves and chuck in useless slideshows and vocabulary to sound knowledgeable. Honestly, what makes UoE worth it to me, is the beautiful and accessible city that surrounds it; as well as knowing that regardless of the quality of my education, at the end of my degree when I begin my career it won&#39;t matter to employers - the status of the university itself, I fear, is what has more importance. Ultimately, UoE has some questionable priorities in terms of teaching quality and student support, but I&#39;d imagine that this is no different from plenty of other UK universities.

This year I have moved to the city and about 50% of the course is in person. They have reflected this with their grades and have chosen to grade work with less leeway this year and upping the standards expected. As a second-year student, this doesn't feel fair considering everything is new to us in regards to the way that the university works. When the course was all online last year there was no assistance with navigating the website and all the platforms used for studying, this is something I feel could be improved upon and not just expected for students to be able to do autonomously. \n\nAll in all, Edinburgh is a beautiful city and has a wide range of facilities to make student life enjoyable including a plethora of societies and clubs all of which are very inclusive and accessible.

          "review": "I had a very positive experience studying Economics at the University of Edinburgh. For an undergraduate course, the economics coursework is actually very technical and rigorous and prepares students well for the either the workforce or continued studies. For people who know they want to study economics, the courses can be very useful and prepare you well for theb rigour of postgrad-level study. However, if you&#39;re not sure if you want to do economics, then the difficulty of the material might seem a bit overwhelming, especially if you&#39;re taking econ courses as optional outside courses to some other degree. The environmental studies portion of my degree was also incredibly useful and allowed me to study ecology and biology and catered well to my specifc interests within the field of economics. \nEdinburgh also allows students to go abroad in their third year, which was an incredible opportunity for me, as I studied environmental economics at The University of Auckland in New Zealand. \nThe writing of a dissertation in final year, while challenging, was also very useful and gives students a better idea of what types of research they might want to pursue in further education. \nEdinburgh is also a great student city with no shortage of things to do. \nThat being said, it is not perfect. Within the school of econ, the quality of lecturers and personal tutors is highly variable, and some (not all) of you course marks will come down to chance/luck. Some courses are taught jointly by professors, and whether you get a first or 2:1 in a course may simply come down to which professor is marking your paper (which if you&#39;re on the border of one degree classification over another, is a really terrifying prospect). Similarly, you have some power over who your dissertation supervisor is, but not complete power. Some supervisors tend to be very generous markers and will regularly meet with you to discuss your progress and make suggestions, others see supervision more as an obligation and leave it to you to figure most everything out. When you&#39;ve studied there after 3 years, you get a good idea of which professors roughly fall into which category. Some personal tutors genuinely take interest in their students, others likely forget that you exist. \nI should note that these issues likely exist across all UK unis, but from hearing anecdotes in the years since I&#39;ve graduated, the school hasn&#39;t done much to correct these issues and they may have actually worsened. \nOverall, if you&#39;re a capable student who wants to study econ, then Edinburgh is great school to do it at, if not one of the best in the UK. A final note would be that Edinburgh econ is a bit notorious for tougher marking compared to econ other UK unis.",

          "review": "I had an excellent experience at The University of Edinburgh which, while not perfect, still allowed me to learn a lot. \nThe biggest pro would be the rigour of the coursework at the undergraduate level. If you&#39;re planning on doing postgraduate study, I feel as though the courses prepare you well for that. The flip side is that courses tend to have a theoretical focus, so there are fewer options in terms of applied economics. People who aren&#39;t sure if they want to study economics and are taking introductory courses to see if they&#39;ll be interested in it might be put off by the maths necessary and the difficulty of first-year courses. \nProfessors can be a mixed bag. This is particularly consequential when choosing a dissertation supervisor. Some are very engaged and supportive, others see supervision as a stipulation of their job and don&#39;t offer much input. There is also a great deal of variability in how harshly they mark.\nThat aside, I had a very positive experience and I think Edinburgh is probably one of the best schools in the UK to attend for undergrad-level econ.

The programme happened when Covid first hit so there were many activities we didn't get to take part in like trips to Colombia and Estonia. We never got any tuition rebate even though so many resources were taken away. It's of course not the University's fault, but we shouldn't have had to pay full price for half a program.",

The university tries too hard to be like Cambridge or oxford focusing mostly on research and as a result, the courses are not very well organised. This is a university for those who already have lots of experience in their chosen studies. If you have several years prior experience and enough money to fully support yourself throughout your studies then I would recommend it. Money is available but it is a pain to get sorted.

With Scandinavian studies, I think there is a remarkable choice of courses that really vary; a student can choose whether they want to focus more on the literary side of things or the linguistics side or a combination of both, so that it really is a versatile programme. Whilst the teaching itself is very good, one qualm is that communication between students and teachers could be improved, and students sometimes feel as though they are lacking guidance. This may be due to the large size of the student population, which also leads to a strain on resources. For example, it can be very difficult for a student to find study space on campus. Overall, I would say that a good quality of education and a good student experience can be found studying in Edinburgh.",

From the diverse range of modules to the dedicated professors, and the outstanding careers support network, every aspect of my time here has exceeded my expectations.\n\nOne of the standout features of Loughborough University is the passion and expertise of my professors. Their knowledge and enthusiasm for their subjects made each lecture and seminar an engaging and informative. The diverse range of modules offered within the Politics and International Relations program allowed me to explore various areas of interest including current global affairs and political science. Whether it was studying comparative politics, international relations theory, or global governance, the curriculum was both stimulating and intellectually challenging.\n\nLoughborough University&#39;s careers support network is truly exceptional. During my second year, when I was searching for a placement, and throughout my final year when I was seeking a graduate job, I was provided with valuable support and guidance. The university offered mock assessment centres and tailored workshops, which helped me refine my skills and build confidence in the professional world. The feedback I received from careers advisors was insightful and constructive, enabling me to improve and present myself effectively during interviews and assessment centers. Thanks to their dedicated assistance, I felt well-prepared and confident as I transitioned from student to the professional life.\n\nIn addition, Loughborough University has a vibrant and fulfilling university life. The campus has ample green and open spaces for learning and socialising. As a top-ranked university in sports worldwide, the facilities available are nothing short of extraordinary with two gyms on campus. Whether it was joining a sports team or participating in sports-related events, the university&#39;s commitment to promoting an active lifestyle greatly enhanced my overall university experience. This unique blend of academic excellence and sporting opportunities truly sets Loughborough University apart.\n\nIn conclusion, my time at Loughborough University has been a transformative journey. The diverse modules, passionate professors, and exceptional careers support network have not only deepened my knowledge in Politics and International Relations but also equipped me with the necessary skills for future success. The campus&#39;s beautiful surroundings and world-class sports facilities have allowed me to pursue my passion for sports alongside my academic pursuits. I highly recommend Loughborough University to anyone seeking an outstanding education and a fulfilling university experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

On top of the academic faculty and buildings, the university has many well maintained sports fields and courts, both indoor and outdoor with plenty of room and organized sports to participate for anyone at any level. However, the administrative staff and decision making is below 1 star, not at all matching the university's status and position globally. Their marketing to spotlight their university internationally is amazing, but nothing inside matches the advertised \"greatness\". Fresher's are all over campus, which with so many unattended events, the campus and housings are always trashed. As a postgraduate who loves to enjoy social gatherings, sports matched and events, the immaturity of younger fellows disrupted even the bus rides or hallways between classes that interrupted everything else. Moreover, during the exam weeks, there is always a shortage of group seatings. Usually a group of 2 or 3 will occupy a study desk or computer desk of at least 8 computers/seatings, making it unavailable for anyone else. There will be, without a doubt, a shortage of study space for any student whether or not wanting to study in group, regardless of the 'availability' the \"lboro study space\" app would demonstrate. The great academic status and professional reputation of this university is in its elite scientists who are likely being paid well just to stay, but this doesn't always translate to great education for upcoming scientists and professional (students). I suggest considering more globally renowned institutions that are accessible to you, rather than falling for a merely statistics of a specific-topic leading institute like Loughborough University (leading sports sciences program worldwide).",

Tutors were significantly late to lectures and then laughed about it. Tutors took annual leave during term time. \n- Students were out of control and extremely disruptive, tutors did very little to resolve this issue and on numerous occasions laughed at and therefore encouraging their disruptive behaviour. \n- I had lessons that were scheduled to be 2 hours long with 45-minute breaks, reducing the lesson time significantly. \n- I attended lessons where the lecture was pre-recorded and played to us on the screen. I had to go to the university to watch a pre-recorded lesson over zoom. \n- Lectures were not present at their own classes and took them over zoom, again we had to attend a class to sit and watch a lesson over zoom. In some cases, it took a number of weeks before I saw the tutor physically present in the classroom. \n- The blended learning ended halfway through the year, and all students were required to attend all lectures in person with no exception. Which would have been fine had it not been extremely contradictory to the fact that half of the lessons were online classes as it was &quot;more convenient” due to classes having 300+ students in with rooms only able to hold around 100.\n- I witnessed a significant number of students (I would estimate at around 50) being turned away from a class that they were scheduled to attend as the room held fewer students than were enrolled in the class , and the room was already full. I heard them being told they had to go to another room where the lesson was being streamed on a zoom call.\nI expressed concerns over marking as I felt that some of the feedback given was not in line with the work that was submitted. I felt that none of my queries were taken seriously and as a result of this, I feel that I have come away with less than I worked for. \nI found that this university often made mistakes regarding the publications of awards. My records were updated with a mark that was significantly lower than the one stated on the work and when receiving my final publication I was being given the wrong degree.\nI felt as though the requirement for an MSc from this university was extremely low and not on par with what I would expect from a postgraduate degree. The national average for a MSc Dissertation is between 15,000 and 20,000 words. The maximum word count for my MSc dissertation was 4000 - this is less that I was required to write for my BA. \n\nWhen I raised my concerns to the university I felt that I was met with a very detached and defensive approach and I was made to feel as though I was at fault. After this interaction, I felt cast aside and treated very differently by staff members. I feel that I have spent in excess of £10,000 to learn absolutely nothing. I am very ashamed to say that I attended this university and plan to keep that fact as hidden as possible. If I could go back I would avoid UCA and attend a faculty that takes education seriously.  <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "I attend UCA doing Music Business and Management via the business school. \n \n\n The main thing to consider before joining UCA, specifically on a business course, is that a lot of the units are cross-taught. Entire units will be a mix of fashion, music and general advertising. If you&#39;re looking for a more well-rounded education in the creative industries, then this would be a good fit. However if you&#39;re looking to specialise in one of the industries as a whole, you may find it frustrating, as there isn&#39;t a whole lot of deep-diving into industry specifics.\n \n\n Securing placements via the uni are difficult, and can feel like you&#39;ve been thrown in to the deep end without armbands.\n \n\n Lecturers themselves are hit or miss, with some being genuinely interested in your progression and some being very by the book and dismissive of criticism. Some also can be very patronising and treat you like you&#39;re a child.\n \n\n I&#39;d recommend UCA to anyone looking for a well-rounded creative career but not to anyone looking to specialise and deep-dive into one specific creative industry. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

This smaller atmosphere makes it probably the most cozy university around. \n \n\n The highlights of UCA is most probably the abundance of equipment; you&#39;re encouraged to use it all regardless of what course you take. From 3D printing and wood working, to screen printers and rizographic printers, it&#39;s all for the taking. The library resources are also plentiful and make research interesting from the get-go. \n \n\n I&#39;d say the main issue is probably the accommodation; there is very little on-site so if you want it you&#39;ll have to get in there super quickly, otherwise the other student villages are a kittle bit of a trek being around a 20 minute walk from the main campus, which doesn&#39;t feel so good in winter when it&#39;s dark all the time. The only other option would be to rent a place in something like a house share, as those can often be a fair bit closer. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The two sports I learnt have taught me so much about myself as well as taught me skills I can take into a professional environment like patience. I highly recommend joining societies at your university. It's in a small town so it was difficult to find a job, so you've got to be quick before they get taken by other students.

I had been very excited to start the course, and prior to applying, I had hoped that it would be on campus because I wanted a real university experience. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my university courses have been moved online, and I have had to adjust my expectations Sadly, because of the COVID pandemic, I could not step foot on campus, let alone live in the accommodations. This had been a huge disappointment to me, and I had to resign myself to the fact that I was not going to be able to experience a physical campus atmosphere. I felt like my university experience had been stunted because of the pandemic, and while this was not technically the university&#39;s fault, it just felt unfortunate. The course was pretty good, and I&#39;d say it&#39;s still a good course I just feel like it was kind of ruined because of the pandemic, but I still love the course and the university. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "Not sure what kind of impact this may have, but at this point I am quite determined to have some kind of justice. I can only talk for the Computer Science department masters: if you are smart and have any doubt, stay away from here! I am into Data Science/Computer Science MSc, and Birkbeck Uni is terrible, borderline scam.\n\nThe most glaring issue: randomly assigned thesis supervisors. You've read it right. You will be assigned one randomly with no option to change it. How it works: they make you answer an extremely generic \"questionnaire\" very late towards the end of the MSc (while you want to start researching and working on your topic earlier). This \"questionnaire\" is composed by 1 (one!) multiple choice question with 4-5 options, each indicating an extremely broad area of \"potential interest\" (like one is \"Artificial Intelligence\" - how do you choose the sub-area in that universe!). Then, based on your answer, they assign you the \"best-fit\" supervisor for that area. If you're wondering if this means your work on your topic of preference will be revised by a complete stranger that has no experience or knowledge whatsoever in your actual subject of preference, that is correct. Then, the supervisor will be of no help, or rather detrimental, not replying to emails or very late and giving no support whatsoever. This is just a way for the understaffed Birkbeck personnel to \"manage\" students and get away with less work.\n\nOther major issues: courses are generally very lacking and badly combined. The Data Science (DS) MSc is put together with a complete lack of vision. Students are not tested for previous knowledge of statistics on admission, and a course in Data Analytics with R is shoved down your throat in the first semester, without any previous introductory course. This resulted in an absolute mess of a course where 30% of the class was completely lost and continuously interrupting the lessons for, guess what, beginner's questions. This was despite the teacher's best efforts in putting what, anyways, was a messy set of lessons that ranged from elementary to advanced topics.\nThe DS MSc includes two *mandatory* courses that are \"taught\" by the pretentious MSc Director himself, which are are a horrible mess of copy-pasted googled material (no joke), and \"taught\" ridiculously in a pidgin English.\nThe rest are classic CompSci courses stripped down in content to fit the schedule without any vision. Essential topics like Data Structures and Algorithms are basically skimmed over, while lots of time is dedicated to basic topics the industry has zero interest in (e.g. boolean calculations by hand). After talking to other students, I gathered that also the optional modules are similarly bad.\n\nRealising the mess that Data Science MSc is midway into it, I switched to Computer Science (they \"allow\" you to do that with a fee of about 800£ for an extra exam to do). There, the situation is less bad, as there is a bit more vision to the teaching. However, the MSc is still very basic; sometimes they cut material useful for professionals (most of the time), sometimes for Academics (prospective PhDs), with little vision.\n\nAnd again, there was little to do when it came to the most important part of any MSc: the final project and the randomly assigned supervisor. If you care about any kind of supervision, good luck. If you're happy on doing the project yourself, like doing your own app and writing a bunch of thesis pages on it, you'll be ok – then again I can't see why you'd have chosen a MSc degree in the first place. Most students were incredibly frustrated and/or unsatisfied.\n\nIf you are looking for a Computer Science program, I'd go for another Uni. The randomized thesis supervisor is unique to BBK Computer Science Department. I know for a fact that other BBK Departments (e.g. Psychology) do not have such system (yet). I then learned that City University also has a similar randomized system, although less bad. Just be aware that the general quality of teaching and student support at BBK is so low that you'd better stay away.",

This experience allowed me to gain practical insights and apply my learning in real-life scenarios. I was fortunate to have a dedicated group of teachers who possessed extensive work experience, prioritizing practical application and case studies over mere theoretical learning. This approach ensured that I emerged from school equipped with valuable, usable knowledge that I could readily apply in professional settings. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

          "review": "Great academic standards, has a high rate of diversity inclusion but student welfare and support support services (Housing, Lecture duration, Administrative accessibility and course timetable flexibility) needs improvement.\n\nThe University can boast of its teaching staffs diversity, made up of over 80% African, Indian and European lecturers, 5% Asian, and 15% British lecturers. Likewise, there is a mix of cultural diversity amongst its non-teaching staffs, with Africans, Indians and Pakistanis making up the numbers with other Europeans and British.\n\nAmong its very unique qualities and applauded successes, which includes; a high-rate of international students acceptance, serene environment, modern infrastructures, and the quality of its teaching staffs that boast of a mix of both young and old, alumnus and industry experts with extensive professional experience and skills. Also, the University can also boast of its boisterous and energetic student unionist and career support engagements. And the school is very affordable in terms of quality learning, mentorship and academic excellence, with great emphasis on ensuring students acquire the required knowledge, skills and independence to hold their own in the corporate environment.\n\nHowever, some of its major low scoring areas includes; International post-graduate students welfare, flexibility with learning schedules and duration of lectures. Other areas which needs to be addressed in terms of its quality of service includes; housing, transportation and administrative support to students needs, direct access to technical support, information relating to immigration, transfer program and program advisory (the university currently run a centralised student service desk that oftentimes do not have a clue on subject matters, understand the need for critical deliberation, and not proactive enough in terms of time management), while seeking redress on crucial matters or allocating cases.\n\nAlso, housing is a major glitch as the locals intentionally extort students, demanding for ridiculous amounts and requirements. While the school, rather than focus on a CSR program to get assist student in settling well and fast in terms of subsidising housing, transportation and making provisions for international post-graduate students with dependents, are more concerned in marketing their hostels out to Bachelor or single students (with ridiculous demand for extended rent duration of 6 months or more). Similarly, the attitude of the campus busses is sickening as well. These drivers do not care if students miss their early classes that begins by 9 am or bother if students waited at the bus stop for hours. Sometimes, you see them take a smoke break at the detriment of students missing lectures. And the security operatives within the school premises, especially the Library, can be rude!\n\nAgain, the duration of the an hour for the amount of volume to learn, compressed time tables, and early classes (beginning by 9am) is really unfair because students had to travel daily from kilometers aways, as far Manchester, Glasgow, Kent etc., just to attend classes. A situation created by the local landlord&#39;s who ridiculous demand international students pay from their nose, provide document from a UK house owner, before agreeing to lettings. Worst of, after several complaints, the school has done nothing to address the matter.\n\nLastly, the attitude of some lecturers in skimming through their lecture notes, racing to complete their one hour classes early and leave students with their misery is a challenge. Students complaints of the volume of materials and resources to learn within an 8-Weeks duration with all the challenges. In fact, social life for post-graduate students, active participation in sports, work on campus, student unionism etc., favours onsite single and undergraduates more than international post-graduate students with dependants.\n\nLikewise, recruitment of students to subsidise jobs in areas of corporate management, planning, administration, teaching assistance etc., by tapping into the skills and qualities of these International post-graduate students should be encouraged to create a synergy and ease of integrate during and after studies as obtainable in the US. In US, students can take up employment in relation to their study within and outside the campus.\n\nIn summary, University of Hertfordshire has impacted knowledge and created quality experience. However, there is room for improvement, active student engagement with proactive decision making, and scale-up in future.\n\n <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

At Hertfordshire there have an additional program which is the NIPE module that is already included in the 3 year course where as most Universities do not include this, this was one of the main reasons I chose UOH. The campus is actually beautiful, I live in accommodation and the rooms are modern and fresh. The campus is very green and modern. It’s close to london which is a bonus! I really enjoy my course at UOH, we go on placement every 2 months which is good as we learn lots of skills.

Aside from that, UoH does offer a variety of recourses where students can utilise to help make learning easier (it’s just up to the student to take them).

I will not only be able to share my instrumental knowledge but also expect to put in my contribution to the research and development in the field of Artificial intelligence and Robotics. Due to University's major contribution in research-based study inevitably co-relates with my field of study and interest and it has therefore become a valid choice for me to study in such a competitive environment.\nWhy I chose to study Artificial intelligence and Robotics with work placement? It is the right step towards my new long-term goal of obtaining or getting my masters degree from a sophisticated education system. Artificial Intelligence has been created by humans for us to imagine a secure, healthy, connected future ahead.\nMechanical Engineering plays a catalyst in this process of imagination. Mechanical Engineering is a branch of Engineering dealing with Design, construction and machines. Within this, a significant area which is related to Artificial Intelligence is Mechanical Design. The sector of Mechanical Engineering is the primary consumer of Artificial Intelligence as a technology. It is more than any other industry; it is consumed the most in Mechanical designs or engineering works. Sections of Mechanical Engineering like Robotics, Automation, or sensor technology uses Artificial Intelligence as a technology. So, it is easy to say that Mechanical Engineering disseminates the application and use of AI in the system.\nThe idea behind the work of Artificial Intelligence remains the same. It performs activities without humans yet with increased tendency as compared to humans. It is prioritizing the automated part\n\nof work, where we feed the computer with data, and as per the command, the machine/process continues its functio",

It's a bit hard to get a part-time job as the town of Hatfield is very small with a large student population looking for work. \n\nMy course Msc International Business was not worth it, I am a studious and career-oriented person from a middle-class family, and we spend so much money on my education. The problem is that they didn't teach me anything worthwhile, the course was even easier than my bachelor's in India. As the course is easy, they did not teach me anything industry-relevant. The course is very broad so there are no specific skill sets you get to learn. Most of my coursemates also were not able to secure jobs or work after that. \n\nSo if you are from a Middle-class family like me and if you want to work after your course then I would advise you not to take it, better try to go for something more specific, but if you are from a rich family and just want to get a easy UK degree just for the sake of it then you can go for it. Also, It appears as if this course is just a way for universities to make money from this course and people in the industry are also well aware that this course is not up to the standards. \n\nPs- I scored a distinction but still had to come back to India and start with a 25k job that was also so hard to get. Now I have got promoted and earning a bit better. I think now in the coming years I can look forward to a decent career.",

I learned more about myself, my strengths, my interests, and my areas of improvement than I had imagined I could while studying this course, and I credit this majorly to handful of notable members of staff who greatly impacted my time here.

I started doing voluntary works and started to attend different courses for enhancing my leadership and teamwork capabilities. In Queen's, I learnt to focus on the quality of knowledge that I have been receiving and doing that I built up a lot of skills which includes communication, teamwork and attention to detail. Even during pandemic, I was able to attend different courses and I dealt with people of diverse culture as in Queen's the key to a better future is to built up a network that goes a long way. The immense support from teachers and my advisor had also made my days in Queen's to be more efficient and beneficial. For each of my modules, along with building up my IT skills, I learnt to be more proactive and determined. Now, I believe along with building up a better profile, having a great focus is very important for future endeavors. Although, it is a pretty challenging situation during this pandemic but I am overwhelmed to receive such help and gratitude from my tutors who are helping me to guide and build up my research profile for heading towards a doctoral degree in the future.

There are plenty of courses that this university offers but I think their business school should be at the very top. The lecturers and professors have always been really open to discuss and help in any way possible, and have supported me throughout my courses.\nHowever, some of the lecture rooms I would say are quite congested and need improvement. Some members of the staff that hold really important positions and roles in the university take a lot of times to reply to mails, and the careers hub is not that helpful.\nBut, overall, my experience has been really good so far and I would recommend other students to LSBU as one of their options as well, when applying. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Secondly, I had amazing teachers who have knowledge and passion for what they are doing and they were able to impact knowledge to their students including myself. That being said, it is my opinion that the school should improve the course by providing enabling opportunities of internships for their students through partnerships with international organizations and international law practicing organizations. I also suggest they provide an option of learning an international language for free within the school, for the international law students which will be an added advantage for the students. Personally, i also think students from Africa running their masters (those holding only African passports and without permanent leave to stay in the UK) are on a disadvantage side because the chances of getting internships after the program is difficult as internships within the UK or EU require you have work permit within the EU and a lot of international internships are not paid.

The university has several London-centre based campuses that are incredibly handy in terms of transport and accommodation.\nMy course has certainly been more challenging in the second year, however, I am satisfied with the overall results. Not only I was able to grow as a person, make friends for life learn new design and critical thinking skills, but it gave me the confidence to work for myself. I learned I can start and finish a task I gave to myself. That is something I was unable to do before. ABsolutely love my time at Westminster and I will miss being there.",

The campus library and central London location were great. The workshops were quite good and the studio space was nice but the open plan made it quite hectic during busy periods.

The online platform provided by the university was user-friendly and allowed me to access all the necessary resources and materials needed for my studies. The coursework was challenging and kept me engaged throughout the program.\n\nOne of the highlights of my experience was the practical aspect of the course, which was still accessible through the online platform. The university provided several opportunities for hands-on learning, including virtual visits to healthcare facilities and public health projects, which helped me to better understand the real-life application of the concepts I was learning.\n\nOne aspect that could be improved was the availability of individual support. While the faculty members were knowledgeable and approachable, I sometimes struggled to get the one-on-one support I needed to succeed in some of the more challenging coursework through the online format.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience studying the MSc in Public Health program online at the University of South Wales was mostly positive, and I would recommend the program to anyone interested in pursuing a career in public health. The curriculum was comprehensive and practical, and the online platform was user-friendly. However, individual support could be improved in the online format.",

This means for a 2000 word essay, you may only get one sentence of feedback which I find limiting as I don’t know how to improve.

At the heart of a bustling and busy Norwich City, UEA drew me in with smiling faces, expansive campus grounds and a myriad of extra-curricular activities. I also found my dream degree with a combination of two subjects I have become quite passionate about, despite my personal, initial reservations. As a result of taking Media and International Development, I have learned so much about how (as an example) mainstream media and other media forms affect and are received by the global population regardless of social or physical differences. However, that is just a glimpse of what is possible here. Outside of academics, I was also able to use my love for and new understanding of Media and Development to kickstart a merchandising business featuring my own graphic designs, where I aimed for the proceeds to go to a charity or NGO of my choice. Furthermore, UEA&#39;s societies are endless and cater to whatever interests you may have, you even have the option to suggest ideas for new ones too! For me personally, I loved the baking, dodgeball and cheerleading groups where I was able to fit exercise and creative fun into busy weeks of lectures all while making so many friends. I also quickly fell in love with the nightlife in the university and Norwich as a whole; having met so many different people from all over the world let alone the UK in the LCR/Hive. For anyone passionate about media, arts and film, I would definitely recommend the University of East Anglia, look forward to having the experience of a lifetime! <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I will say that the general student support has let me down a little, I have a great relationship with some staff members on my course who have helped me massively during my time there though luckily, but without them, I think I really would have struggled.",

          "review": "My time at UEA has so far exceptional. 2020 resulted in many students feeling at a loss, unsupported and feeling cheated for the amount of tuition fees spouted out with minimum teaching time. However, I can say that my course, without its challenges, had exceptional teaching staff and high quality course content. The layout of the student learning interface and the organisation of the lectures, coursework, and reading materials made this year enjoyable and interesting. The support available to students is definitely improving, with students services and advisors on hand to help with academic questions and personal troubles. The campus has brutalist architecture - take as you will - but the grounds are stunning. The campus rests on a national park which boasts a stunning stream, lake and ample grasslands for running, walking or chilling with friends. The city of Norwich itself is affordable, historic, artistic and small. There is ample for you to see if you search for it, however, if you are expecting a bustling city like London, Bristol or Manchester then you will be dissapointed. Other students in my course did encounter external difficulties which affected their studies, and most of them found the support they needed to continue their studies and complete it with a good grade. Most importantly, everyone who took the foundation year improved their grades and their academic ability throughout the course, and I am excited to start the next year! I actually cannot wait! Exam periods and deadlines are stressful - but the expectations placed on you are realistic - you will not be asked to complete a 2000 word essay which contributes to your final grade a week before its due (I know that other universities test their students this way). The university is close to London considering how Far East Norwich is, and cities like Cambridge, colchester and nature reserves surround in counties like Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Overall, I cannot fault the university. However, online learning has been a challenge, with lockdowns in the UK you will be bored if you come here for study abroad but that is like that all across the UK. Just something to keep in mind.",

I am studying law with European legal systems and I absolutely love it so far. The school of law is really great and there are tons of opportunities outside of your studies that can help you gain skills like competitions like mooting or negotiations (both of which I took part in) or by having the opportunity to apply for student pupillages and internships in law firms the UEA has partnerships with or alumni working there. The campus can be quite ‘boring’ or ‘gloomy’ because the buildings (in the campus) are all grey and made of concrete, however, the university has plenty of resources. The sports park (gym) has tons of facilities and there are so many opportunities to join sport clubs or societies. There is a bar on campus which is great, and there’s a night out every Tuesday and Saturday at the LCR which means you don’t have to go to the city if you want to go out. Another amazing plus is the environment around the UEA. There is loads of green space and even a lake, and although the buildings aren’t pretty, the greenery does make it a lot better.",

          "review": "The English Language and Linguistics course is a well-rounded program that covers a variety of topics related to language and communication. The course is divided into six modules, each of which provides students with a comprehensive understanding of different aspects of the English language.\n\nThe first module, &quot;How Language Works 1,&quot; introduces students to the basic concepts of language and linguistics. It provides a solid foundation for the rest of the course and ensures that students are equipped with the necessary knowledge to succeed in the subsequent modules.\n\nThe second module, &quot;Understanding Communication,&quot; focuses on the ways in which language is used to communicate meaning. This module covers topics such as speech acts, pragmatics, and discourse analysis. The discussions and exercises in this module are thought-provoking and engaging, encouraging students to think critically about how language is used in different contexts.\n\nThe third module, &quot;Language and the Mind,&quot; is one of the most fascinating modules of the course. This module delves into the psychological processes involved in language production and comprehension. The module covers topics such as language acquisition, language processing, and bilingualism. The insights gained from this module are useful not only for understanding language but also for understanding the human mind.\n\nThe fourth module, &quot;How Language Works 2,&quot; builds on the foundation provided by the first module and explores more advanced linguistic concepts such as syntax, semantics, and phonology. This module is challenging, but the materials and exercises are designed to help students master these concepts.\n\nThe fifth module, &quot;Developing English: History and Society,&quot; provides a historical and sociolinguistic perspective on the English language. This module covers topics such as language change, dialects, and language policy. The materials are well-organized, and the discussions are informative and thought-provoking.\n\nThe final module, &quot;Reading and Writing in the Digital Age,&quot; explores the impact of technology on language and communication. This module covers topics such as digital literacy, social media, and online discourse. The module provides useful insights into how language is evolving in the digital age.\n\nOverall, the English Language and Linguistics course is a comprehensive and engaging program that covers a wide range of topics related to language and communication. However, there are some criticisms worth noting. The course could benefit from more opportunities for hands-on application of the concepts learned in each module. Additionally, some students may find the course challenging due to the level of detail and complexity of the materials covered.\n\nIn conclusion, the English Language and Linguistics course is a highly recommended program for anyone interested in language and communication. The course provides a solid foundation in linguistic concepts and theories, and the materials and discussions are engaging and informative. While there are some criticisms worth noting, the overall quality of the course makes it a valuable investment for any student looking to deepen their understanding of language and communication. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

For my course anyway, teachers will reach out to help you and you&#39;re absolutely encouraged to do the same. I feel that the support could however be slightly improved upon, with a more equal balance of understanding of mental health and obviously pushing you to succeed. With COVID restrictions in Wales, I haven&#39;t had much chance to use the facilities here, but since February they&#39;ve been great. Some of them need updating as they&#39;re really outdated but most are absolutely fine. The student union in terms of the actual union is great, however clubbing in the student union building is horrible as they allow it to overcrowd. I hope they increase capacity and lower the amount of people allowed in. One more thing that could be improved is communication between the university and students, as we are often told important things last minute and have to find the info ourselves through convoluted methods. Overall though, I&#39;d definitely recommend this uni if you don&#39;t want to go to a massive city like London, as there aren&#39;t that many services here and the transport is, to put it lightly, lacking. You might struggle with finding international foods too as well as services because Cardiff isn&#39;t very ethnically diverse compared to, for example, Birmingham. I love experiencing Welsh culture here though, so you get diversity in the sense of it being very Welsh. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The faculty are so helpful, approachable and open to any kind of feedback, advice or just a casual chat. The campus itself is stunning, spread out over the downtown Cardiff and the Heath Hospital, with several libraries, study spaces and open areas for socialising. The student&#39;s union has recently been remodelled, and is comfortable, multipurpose and extremely social with plenty of events being organised on a regular basis. Cardiff as a city itself is the perfect amount of bustling and cosy, and is not too big that it gets overwhelming or not too small and empty that it feels boring and lacks variety in activities. Furthermore, as an international student I was very concerned about the culture shock and welcoming environment I&#39;d face at Cardiff Uni and the city, but Wales has defeated all concerns. The people here are always kind and warm and the environment at the university is extremely inclusive of differing opinions.

My advice for any new prospecting students is to kern how to cook and bring ear plugs for the nights where you don&#39;t want to go out but everyone else does. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

It&#39;s also a really beautiful city that&#39;s not too big and overcrowded, but big enough that you&#39;re never bored. Cardiff and surrounding area is really pretty, with lots of great hikes and the Brecon Beacons just outside the city. The school does a great job of keeping costs low as well by providing all the books we need for classes in the library, and we can access most articles and reading online with the option to order it for free if it&#39;s not already accessible to us. What could be improved is the support for students in terms of mental health and wellbeing. I was going through a really hard time as an international student and was told I could only speak to a therapist if I was suicidal. Eventually I went through a traumatic experience and was allocated a therapist, but was limited to only 6 sessions with this person. It helped, but wasn&#39;t enough, and someone shouldn&#39;t have to go through a traumatic experience or be suicidal to get help. There&#39;s also not a ton of quiet study spaces, and the campus itself doesn&#39;t feel very connected. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

There's a wide variety of modules and the opportunity to study abroad is a really valuable one, which gave me a new appreciation of my studies and added new perspectives when I returned home.

It is located in its own campus at Nayarhat, Savar, Dhaka adjacent to the Dhaka-Aricha highway and enjoys excellent communication facilities connecting among important cities of the country. The total campus area of NITER is 13.06 Acres with adequate built up space in its academic, administrative, hostels, Canteen and other buildings.\n\nAs per the decision of the Ministry of Textiles & Jute, NITER has been running under the management of ‘Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA)’ since September 2008. An operational agreement was signed between ‘Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA)’ and ‘Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC)’ under the Ministry of Textiles & Jute. After signing the agreement, BTMA actively took the responsibilities of NITER on May, 2009. That time it was known as ‘National Institute of Textile Training Research and Design (NITTRAD)’.\n\nBTMA expanded the academic span of the institute and started B. Sc. in Textile Engineering course under the Faculty of Engineering & Technology of the University of Dhaka. From 2010-2011 session, B. Sc. in Textile Engineering course was started. Considering the nature and future prospect of this institute, the University of Dhaka requested the Ministry of Textiles & Jute to change the name of NITTRAD. Accordingly the Ministry renamed NITTRAD as ‘National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER)’ from January 2013.\n\nApart from Textile Engineering course, NITER is also offering two other important courses, B. Sc. in Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) and Fashion Design & Apparel Engineering (FDAE) program to meet the present demand of our textile and RMG sector. NITER has been operating B. Sc. in Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) from 2016-2017 session and B. Sc. in Fashion Design & Apparel Engineering (FDAE) from 2017-2018 session. Now, more than 1,500 students are enrolled in these courses and gradually the number is increasing every year. M. Sc. in Textile Engineering course have started under the academic umbrella of the University of Dhaka.\n\nNITER is being operated by a ‘Governing Body’ consists of the members from BTMA, Ministry of Textiles & Jute, BTMC, University of Dhaka and from the institute as well. Mohammad Ali Khokon, renowned industrialist and the President of BTMA is the Chairman and veteran academician Prof. Dr. Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, Principal, NITER, is the Member-Secretary of the Governing Body.\n\nBackground history of NITER:\n\n‘National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER)’ was previously evolved from ‘Textile Industry Development Center (TIDC)’ which was established in January 1979 and once emerged as the only training centre capable of imparting practical oriented quality training for professionals engaged in the textile manufacturing industry. The main objective was to provide skilled professional manpower for the government-owned textile industries. Later on, from 1994 to 2007 this organization was known as ‘National Institute of Textile Training Research and Design (NITTRAD)’ and was operating need-based short courses related to textiles. In order to meet the upward demand of skilled textile engineers for the textiles and allied sector of Bangladesh, the objective was changed. In this continuance, the operational management of the institute was handed over to Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) on September 2008. Till then, it has been successfully running as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) organization and contributing to meet the acute demand of skilled professionals for our textile and allied sectors.\n\nFacilities of NITER:\n\nNITER has 13.06 acres of land with vibrant greenery and scenic beauty. NITER has adequate numbers of qualified faculty members, officers, and staff. There are Academic buildings and Administrative building with sufficient space. It has all kinds of modern laboratories, sufficient number of class-rooms with adequate space, web-based library, fully equipped computer labs with internet facilities, separate hostels for male & female students with amenities, canteen, playground & indoor games, wifi-zone campus etc. There are several clubs of student activities functioning in different fields. Many seminars, workshops, events take place under different clubs.\n\nFurthermore, NITER has a unique wing namely ‘Research and Industrial Relations (RIR)’ for operating its collaborative research & innovative activities, student’s industrial trainings as well as job placements. Generally a NITER graduate has good demand in the textile job sector and gets employed rapidly.\n\nThere is a Proctorial-body to oversee the rules and regulations and the disciplinary activities of the students. Similarly, Hostels Superintendents are there to look after the resident students of NITER. There are also teacher’s quarters inside the NITER campus.\n\nB.Sc. in Textile Engineering The large and expanding textile and apparel industry in Bangladesh has been placing an increasing demand of highly skilled manpower that is creating a lot of job opportunities. There are demands for textile graduates in other areas of economic activities also. With the aim to meet this demand and strengthen the technological base of the industry, National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER); the first Public-Private Partnership education and research institute in Bangladesh is offering B.Sc. in Textile Engineering Course. NITER is dedicated to provide affordable and accessible high quality education that can be best described as a \"Centre of excellence\".",

Some facilities especially those in the School of Psychology are in dire need of refurbishing but most of the campus was picturesque, giving off an inviting yet distinguished feel especially the Main Building. \n\nMy peers were great, some remain some of my closest friends till today. However, as an international student having completed my first year in Malaysia, it was especially difficult to adapt to the essay (scientific writing) side of modules that would determine how well you did in your exams. I would ask my tutors for advice, as well as my study mates but it was an ongoing skill that needed time to hone in. I often felt like I was trying my hardest to enhance my critical skills and illustrate them in my writing with research evidence but it was still challenging.\n\nOn that note, if we were given more support like optional writing tutorials it would have made the experience much easier. Consequently, we have some very interesting modules but some were quite redundant and so, a revamp or update to allow for a more current and cohesive course would be good. Some lecturers were excellent, it was evident they possess a great passion for their subject, and often the literature or study material would stem from their research. But there were also some dry lectures, reading exactly from slides which weren't as interesting.\n\nIn short, you won't regret coming to this wonderful city with its many gems like parks, libraries, and culture. It made for a memorable and rewarding few years and I'm a proud Cardiff graduate!",

You can tell that a lot of them are there for their research and are forced to teach which is something they don&#39;t want to do. There is also a very strong lack of support for students, many lecturers ignore student emails, barely provide question that can help students practice for exams and if you have any issues with anything they tend to blame the students and most importantly do not try to help, and instead they usually just say it&#39;s always been that way. Honestly, it just feels like the department it out to get you instead of support you and help you. The course overall is a mess. The mechanical aspects of it are the better part of it, better organised and more useful and better lecturers. Whilst the electrical part is not well structured at all, with some modules that are extremely useless overall, and could easily be swapped for more generally useful modules. The workload is pretty extreme, especially taking into account that, unlike most other students in the humanities and management, engineering students do not get a reading week. In terms of non academic aspects, the uni is nice, I have made good friends and there are a lot of societies available. However, within sports clubs it&#39;s hard to feel included and &quot;belong&quot; If you are not good enough to make it to the team.

Firstly, new arriving international students are able to book a school bus before entering the school. The bus picked up students directly at Heathrow Airport and sent them to the school, which is completely free. Besides, the university offers free quarantine services (including providing food and affording PCR test fees) for students who came from high-risk countries. \n\nOverall, University of Bath is actually quite small but complete in every detail (including restaurants, supermarkets, and post office). It only takes about 15 minutes to walk from one side to the other side. The buildings on campus are very modern compared to the buildings in the city center. The university library on-campus is almost open 7x24 all year; moreover, there is a building built in the city center for students to study, which is convenient for students who live in the city center. \n\nAs for the career service, students can get career planning advice, interview skills, and training from the Careers Service team. At the same time, there were some job hunting fairs regularly with a good chance to reach out to business recruiters from different sectors. A large number of top employers gave speeches or one-on-one QA sessions for students who are interested in their business. For instance, I have attended a bunch of workshops (like cover letter writing skills, interview skills, application tips for the graduate schemes, and so on). In addition, I also have some one-on-one meetings with the career coach to improve my CV and interview skills. The university also helps you reach out to other alumni or people having the same experience if it is possible.

          "review": "The university has a range of amazing campuses around Nottingham with many different facilities for the wide range of courses. All courses are well structured and many students receive incredible support from staff. One issue can be the Sutton Bonington campus which is situated 25 minutes away from the city centre. This may become an issue for some students for travel, however the university has given access to a free hopper bus for all students. From personal experience this is a very reliable mode of transport and accessible to all students. I would recommend bringing a car with you if you are able as this saves time with travel, especially for morning lectures. \nAs a student dietitian at the university, I have had a good experience. The modules are all interesting and all lectures are now recorded. Which makes revision easier for exams. One issue I did have was living at Sutton Bonington in my first year as this campus does sometimes make you feel a bit isolated. I would recommend joining a society or the gym as a way to keep occupied. In my second year I lived in Lenton, I would recommend living there to anyone. It is close to the city centre, so amazing when going clubbing or wanting to go shopping. There are also plenty of shops, including Aldi, Lidl and Sainsbury&#39;s. Lenton is also just a 20 minute walk to the University park campus and a 15 minute walk to Jubilee. \nOverall, my experience so far has been incredible at the university and I would highly recommend the university to anyone. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Coming to UoN, you will learn from the scientists and researchers who are the pioneers of their field. Hence, the teaching materials are very detailed, and the modules support each other well.

The university community is very cohesive, bringing in students from all walks of life and promoting an enriched academic community. The facilities on University Park campus are maintained excellently and I use them frequently (libraries, food outlets, self-study areas and so forth). The range of societies is very broad and there is something to suit every interest. However, an element that I do feel is overlooked at UoN is social fragmentation from the disparity of wealth between students; whilst this is more of a broader societal factor, in my personal experience, there is an assumed financial freedom to take part in many university activities which some students do not have. Aside from this, my experience of my course has been positive in terms of teaching and my personal engagement with the content, but there is not a community feel within the course itself compared to my relations with the wider university community. Despite this, I enjoy the campus environment itself, with green spaces and the feeling of safety and security. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The sports facilities are professional level, the social areas are well equipped for all needs and the library is large enough to meet your space needs.

Our chemical department is always equipped with the latest equipment and systems, which allows us to keep up with the times and not put you at a disadvantage. The Student Union believes in supporting students in their work, study and well-being. However, the events held tend to be pub quizzes and small social events, so they can be expanded to include more types of students.The career services are great. Years of support and opportunities.

The programme incolved a combination of clinical modules, focusing on clinical psychology, dementia, child and adolescent mental health, and psychopathology, and research methodology modules, for quantitative, qualitative and systematic review. Each lesson was usually taught by different clinicians or guest professors who would give in depth lectures on a topic. Assessments were usually the application of what was taught in class, presentations and short articles for lay audiences, a short piece of research and research protocols. Module conveners were very approachable and resources were usually easy to access. This course was very challenging at times, as it would require the development of advanced skills to deliver each assessment task in a very short time. I am very satisfied overall.",

The Malaysian Campus was small, but had a lot to offer from exellent services, highly-qualified and helpful staff, and a chance to build character and gain practical experience through the plenty extracurricular activities, communities and clubs. Obviously, the community was very international with students and staff from all around the world. The UK campus was not that different in these aspects, but it was on a larger-scale with far more students and staff, so I would say that the Malaysian Campus was molded after the UK one. The other difference would be that the UK campus offers more courses and a wider variety of modules inside the degrees themselves, some of which are specializations that are only offered by a handful or a couple of universities in the whole of the UK, which makes UoNottingham unique in some of their degree programmes. All in all, no one would regret choosing Nottingham as astudy destination, and given that you utilize all the offered oppurtunities, you will come out a well-rounded individual on your fast-track to becoming either a scholar and professional.",

I also wish I had more relevant optional modules to the course of criminology. There were some very interesting modules from other courses which were relevant to my course but I was unable to select them. Therefore, I chose modules which I wasn't that interested in.

In addition, we also learned about the cooling and heating system, I got 77 points in this course, and there are courses on renewable energy systems and energy efficiency, I got 70 points in this course, and the knowledge in this field is very interest, so I chose \"Modelling optimization of renewable energy integration into buildings\" for my graduation dissertation topic. Besides, My thesis supervisor is also the PHD supervisor I applied for, which is a great honor for me. We have established contacts and in-depth exploration of the foundation I can lay for PHD learning during the completion of the dissertation.",

In terms of my personal academic development, I am a bit disappointed. The physics course is not as mathematical, theoretical or detailed as I am used to. I feel both, a bit less challenged and a bit less promoted. This is the reason, why I almost only gave three stars. \n\nOther than that (and what is probably more important for anyone not looking for a theoretical physics course), the university itself is great. It does definitely deserve four to five stars. \nThe modern facilities, large study spaces and the great student support have already been mentioned. The campus is a lovely, green park.\nThe university has very large, very good organized students union, offering over 200 societies and additionally more than 70 or so sports clubs to join. So in terms of leisure activity and becoming involved there is a lot on offer.\nThe student body is as diverse as I can imagine, with many international students from mostly Europe or Asia.

However, I was impressed by their ability to still cover the course outline effectively, which made it possible for me to gain valuable knowledge and skills. \n\nOverall, my college experience at NACIT was a good one.

          "review": "AMAZING STANDARD OF ONLINE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCED\n\nI can provide information about the potential benefits that I found during my online studies at the University of Derby, England, United Kingdom. As of my last knowledge update from January 2019 to January 2021.\n\nFlexibility: Online studying allows for greater flexibility in terms of when and where you study. This is particularly useful for individuals with busy schedules, those who need to balance work and education, or those who have other commitments.\n\nConvenience: You can access course materials, lectures, and assignments from the comfort of your own space, eliminating the need to commute to a physical campus.\n\nVariety of Courses: Online platforms often offer a wide range of courses, allowing you to explore subjects that might not be available locally.\n\nSelf-Paced Learning: Some online courses are self-paced, which means you can progress through the material at a speed that suits you. This can be especially beneficial for those who want to spend more time on challenging concepts or breeze through topics they&#39;re familiar with.\n\nDiverse Learning Resources: Online courses often make use of various multimedia resources like videos, interactive quizzes, simulations, and online discussion forums, enhancing the learning experience.\n\nGlobal Accessibility: Online courses can be accessed by people from all over the world. This can lead to diverse interactions and exposure to different perspectives.\n\nCost Savings: Online courses can be more affordable than traditional in-person courses, as they eliminate the need for commuting, housing, and other associated costs.\n\nSkill Enhancement: Online courses often focus on practical skills that are relevant to current industries and job markets. This makes them attractive to professionals seeking to enhance their skill sets.\n\nPersonalized Learning: Some online platforms use algorithms to tailor content to your learning pace and preferences, creating a more personalized learning experience.\n\nCareer Advancement: Online learning can allow individuals to continue their education while working full-time, potentially leading to career advancement opportunities.\n\n\nWHAT CAN BE IMPROVED IN ONLINE UNIVERSITY\n\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2021, several areas could be improved in online universities to enhance the overall learning experience. Keep in mind that advancements and changes might have occurred since then. Here are some potential areas for improvement:\n\nEngagement and Interaction: Online learning can sometimes feel isolating. Universities could focus on creating more interactive experiences, such as live virtual classes, group projects, and discussion boards, to foster student-to-student and student-to-instructor engagement.\n\nQuality of Instruction: Ensuring high-quality instruction is crucial. Universities could invest in training faculty and instructors to effectively teach online, including using various instructional technologies and techniques specific to the online environment.\n\nPersonalized Learning: Implementing more sophisticated adaptive learning technologies could help tailor the learning experience to individual students&#39; needs and learning styles, providing targeted support and challenges as necessary.\n\nAssessment Methods: Developing effective and secure methods for online assessments, such as proctored exams, authentic assessments, and automated grading tools, could help maintain academic integrity.\n\nTechnical Support: Robust technical support services are essential to help students navigate any technological challenges they may encounter while studying online.\n\nReal-World Application: Integrating real-world applications and practical experiences, such as virtual internships, lab simulations, and projects with industry partners, can enhance the practicality of online education.\n\nNetworking Opportunities: Providing platforms for students to network with peers, faculty, and professionals can help students build connections and enhance their career prospects.\n\nFeedback and Communication: Establishing clear channels for communication and timely feedback between students and instructors is essential for a successful online learning environment.\n\nEquity and Accessibility: Universities should ensure that online education is accessible to all students, regardless of their backgrounds, disabilities, or technical limitations. This includes designing courses with accessibility in mind and providing necessary accommodations.\n\nCredential Recognition: Ensuring that degrees and certifications obtained through online programs are recognized and respected by employers and educational institutions is important for the credibility of online education.\n\nIntegration of Emerging Technologies: Keeping up with the latest technological advancements, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence, could enhance the immersive and engaging nature of online learning.\n\nRegular Updates: Online course content should be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments in the field, ensuring that students receive relevant and up-to-date information.\n\nMentorship and Advising: Providing online students with mentorship, advising, and career counseling services can help guide their academic and professional paths.\n\nIt&#39;s important to note that the effectiveness of online universities depends on how well they address these areas and adapt to the evolving needs of students and the job market. As technology and education continue to evolve, universities must remain responsive to these changes and continually seek ways to improve the online learning experience.\n\n\nOVERALL STUDY EXPERIENCE\n\nIt&#39;s worth noting that the effectiveness and satisfaction with online study can vary based on personal preferences, learning styles, and the quality of the online course. Additionally, while there are many benefits, online learning also comes with challenges, such as the need for self-discipline, potential feelings of isolation, and technical issues.",

However, at the open evening, the lecturers were not completely honest about the content of the course. Firstly, you have to work with a heritage organization, which they said they had contacts for students that had never worked in heritage before. This turned out not to be the case. I was at a disadvantage because I had never worked in heritage, volunteered or had any contacts in the industry. Also, the history part of the course is mostly based on local history, which was not what I wanted to do. Furthermore, I feel like I have not learnt any useful job skills from the course, it was a complete waste of time for me. In my opinion, if you want to work in heritage, you need to volunteer, and have the time and money to be able to work for free. Also, pick a degree that specializes in what you want to do. For example, archiving or marketing. This degree is too piecemeal. I would not choose this course if I had my time again, I would choose a course that would give me a much better chance of getting a job at the end of it. If this is just for interest, and you do not want a job at the end, then it is a great course. Also, after the first few weeks of doing the course, I knew it was not right and tried to find someone at the university to speak to about changing the course or getting my money back. I found the support absolutely awful. I stuck it out, but I should have gone with my gut feeling and changed courses.",

          "review": "I went through a series of issues at this university other than my personal mitigating circumstances. In my first year, the only module that included programming was taught by a professor who did not know how to teach. I was the only student who passed the module out of the 7 people who took his class. In my second year, I was told that I had not been taught modules to give me enough credits to progress in my course. This eventually led to me doing my second year part-time as I had to do 2 extra modules to earn the previously unobtained credits. Then in my final year, my supervisor just did not come through. She set a standard from a Doctorate level for my final year project and expected me to write a dissertation from the point of view of a Physics major. I was trying my best but it was not acceptable for her so she just failed me in the module. Throughout my university, I continued to struggle with my mental health and was suicidal multiple times. This year was especially hard as a very close friend took his own life. I completely understand that this world does not care about mental health, emotions and personal struggles when it comes to prosperity but what I also firmly believe is that I deserve a good life and definitely better than my experience in the UK. I had a lot of family issues growing up which led to insurmountable childhood trauma. But I never let it affect my academics, I always had control over my education which is the most important part of my life. You would expect that spending tens of thousands to move to another continent for a better life and future would be the best choice to make, it really was not the case for me. In a lot of ways, I feel cheated and also feel that my university does not quite care about me and thousands of other international students, who just like me despite having to start from scratch, have to pay extra fees and do this without much financial support from the country where they are studying. I feel like I did not acquire much from this degree and really wish to do another Bachelors degree even though everyone is advising me against it. I want to spend time actually learning and growing. I know I have the potential but I feel like I have been in the wrong place to bring it out.",

I am sure there are other countries besides Portugal that are considered as a Band A Country where it is difficult to cover such a fee.

The modules that are being provided by the University really caught my attention and interest. The studies are normal paced. The education is in dept and begins from a beginner&#39;s level, thus you do not need any prior knowledge. They make learning fun by providing puzzles that are not only fun to solve but also help you teach coding. They really try to make learning fun and innovative unlike traditional ways. They provide Career Services and micro modules to help students find a job during or after their studies. They also help students to find an internship in their specific profession to gain knowledge and work experience for their professional development and growth, which makes it easier for the students to find work later.",

The school has a support system present for the students and the library has all the resources the students would need/want. The entire learning space is mature and fast-paced. The school, however, needs to work a little on the schedule planning with the students. They need to make plans which work for students in their schedule and help them be regularly in touch with their studio space.\n \n\n I would recommend this school to anyone who is looking to expand their learning horizons and wants to work in a space that not only tutors them, but also makes them better professionals for their future ahead. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I wanted to choose a university which not only bases their teachings on theory, but also the practical aspects of the subject. The location of the University is perfect, away from the hustle-bustle of the city life and yet so close to it! The University is culturally diverse and one is sure to find students from their native country. The atmosphere on campus is friendly and lively at all times making one feel at home.

From attending lectures to completing assignments, I found the whole transition from school to university difficult. From the beginning, I found my schedule to be absolutely jam packed with barely any time for me to relax or socialise, and I had early starts every single day. With my heavy workload and very little time to socialise, I was quickly feeling overwhelmed and underprepared. Even then, my days were so full that sometimes I had to skip lunch so that I could make it to class on time. Then there were the classes, which were so difficult that I couldn&#39;t keep up with what the lecturer was saying and ended up having to play Catan at the end of the day. This led me to have to pull many all-nighters, and I was incredibly sleep deprived. I think I barely scraped a pass in the first year, and I thought about dropping out so often. I feel as though this was a personal issue of mine, and I don&#39;t think that I can say that it is the university&#39;s fault; however, I did feel unsupported, and I did not know who to turn to. Things turned around in my second year when I found a solid group of friends and we would study together, but my first year was hell. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The university provides Loads of societies, which can fit a wide range of interests from the students&#39; side. I promoted as many events as possible to the incoming student to offset my regrets. Meanwhile, I had an opportunity to work with the faculty and understand how hard the school is trying to utilise their resources to give students a better studying experience by promoting all of the support services provided by the university.\n However, sometimes the way of promoting and championing is not as efficient as it should be. For instance, as mentioned, I missed the society showcase, as it only happened once a year. Others who&#39;d like to join the society need to wait for another year or just miss their chances.\n Nevertheless, I enjoyed my stay at the University of Southampton. As it is very international, there are students from all over the world. Therefore, it brought me an opportunity to see and embrace the difference in culture. Meanwhile, studying at the University of Southampton gave me a chance to make many good friends. The friendship that we obtained continued even after my graduation, which cannot be measured in monetary value.\n In terms of the courses, a diverse list of programmes is provided. I studied International Management for my master&#39;s. The programme is well-designed and enjoyable. The topics introduced by the lectures are very up-to-date, with a reasonable amount of assignments. At first, it was challenging. However, I gained loads of capabilities after studying at the UoS. For instance, critical thinking, time management, teamwork, and presentation skills etc., which are highly valued by employers in the job market.\n Therefore, I will recommend the University of Southampton to my friends and students who are applying for Universities. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Teachers are really helpful with the projects, they guide and support you throught the projects, only two of my friends were unlucky about their supervisors, but I was from the lucky ones.. Anyway you can change your supervisor as you wish. I was doing MSc in Computer Science and every week there was a seminar or meeting for our community where famous companies were attending and informing us about their jobs where we could ask questions which was really helpful. Also there were pizza and coffee sessions towards the end, which was really fun. About the lectures, you can choose your field of interest and get related lectures accordingly, which was the first reason that i have choosen University of Southampton, where there is a wide range of lecture selection. The classes were very luxurious where we had turning seats and big screens on top of us to see the slides easily, which felt so classy. The computer labs were really cool, where there were super computers and double screens for coders which every student can use freely and connect their computers for a wider screen as well, which was very useful during group projects. There are busses to the Campus from everywhere of the city, nearly every 10-15 mins, so i had no problem about transportation, as well as many great accomodation choices both owned by the university and the private ones. I was in the private one since it was cheaper and actually, better than the university's rooms to be honest when we did a comparison with friends who were in university's dormitories. Overall, if i had the chance, i could stay there for the rest of my life. So if you find a chance to go there, don't miss out!",

During my time at Southampton, I learned so much about myself and had a large number of highs and some lows which really helped to shape me into the person I am today. In terms of support, I loved all the opportunities to engage with my lecturers and would constantly make office hour visits. I was also granted financial support by the university, which coming from a position where my family cannot financially support me, was vital to my well-being at uni. My course was engaging, offering a range of interesting courses in Philosophy. With an emphasis on Ethics and the philosophy of the mind I developed an interest in being a counsellor, a desire I am still pursuing to this day. Also, extra-curricular activities were frequent and fun and really helped me to make friends and stay social and active. Doing an Erasmus+ exchange in Prague was life-changing and I will always be grateful to the university for facilitating this experience. In terms of negatives, I found the employability support to not be helpful and weak at times. Also, the costs of sports passes and food/supplies on campus were high and limit many students from partaking in casual sports which are vital to wellbeing. Talks given by the university on arrival were not so inspiring and I had to go out, meet people and find my own way to really feel the university spirit. I owe a lot to my alma mater but I didn't find it easy to share their enthusiasm from the beginning, this may be because of the constant battles between student groups and senior managers at the university, not to mention scandals with various lecturers. Overall, my experience was varied, hectic, very social and rounding. Every day had value, good or bad and the path I now follow was definitely formed by my ability to study and travel, talk to interesting lecturers and meet all kinds of people from every background and culture.",

As a part timer, there was limited support and it was a very draining experience. Deadlines were poorly coordinated making for an intense spring term. However, as someone who already has a job in the industry, the wider theoretical study was a fascinating way to work towards RTPI chartership.\n\nThe course coordinators and above were not understanding or respectful when dealing with course issues. This was most notable during prolonged periods of lecture strikes and requests for partial course-fee refunds when over-sea trips could not go ahead due to the pandemic.\n\nThe lecturers themselves were excellent and worked hard to compensate for the lack of wider support and organisation. They were understanding, available and delivered interesting and knowledgeable lectures. The national and European trips were both excellent and an invaluable part of the course, as they pushed students to consider beyond a London-centric approach to planning theory and practise.\n\nOne pays for the name of UCL and the theoretical teachings but the course does not offer solid, all-round preparation for the planning industry. It is an intense experience. The wider university does not support the department and the department does not particularly support the lecturers, and this tension unfortunately negatively impacts the students experience.",

This laughable institution treats students as cash cows and if you ever complain about anything, they'll most likely blame you for it. \n\nIf you make a mistake of coming here like I have here's a few things to keep in mind:\n- don't take language classes, you will not learn anything, some of the professors care, but others realise that since UCL refuses to fund CLIE properly there is no point in actually trying to teach,\n- avoid SELCS, it's a bunch of elitist pseudoscientists, who'll get mad at any criticism you put forward. I spent a year studying French there and the language used during classes was almost exclusively English, not French (this includes actual language classes!!!)\n- Geography department is a financial scam, it's unbelievable institutions can get away with it - taking out a £9250 loan every year for an online lecture and BIWEEKLY seminar is an absolute joke, not to mention that some professors literally don't care about anything but their own research and ignore their teaching responsibilities, not to mention it seems they know very little about what they're supposed to be teaching.\n\nThere are solid departments, in my experience Institute of the Americas/History/Polsci deps are not half bad, professors and tutors seem to care more about students and despite being critically underfunded they actually try to provide quality education.\n\nIt seems to me that realistically going to UCL is a coinflip and if you coin falls on the wrong side you'll ruin your mental health, your wallet and any ambitions you might have had before coming to university.",

I traveled back to my native country after having finished the degree program. The loud claims by Universities is obviously a deceptive marketing practice to attract students particularly international ones who pay thrice the fee of local students. The Office of Fair Trade, House of Commons or Monopoly Control Authority should look into the issue of this misleading claim.

I had all the resources I needed to complete my coursework, from textbooks all the way to a free copy of microsoft word. \n I enjoyed many of my lectures, as the many teachers involved were engaging and provided excellent guidance. However, the lectures were 3 hours long. As someone with ADHD, I found this a little too long to focus and would often become fatigued at the 90 minute mark. I would have preferred the activities be seperated into a smaller, seminar style class. This would have been better to keep me engaged. \nAs I was going through a difficult time during my masters degree, I was offered excellent support by Student Services. With a doctors note, I was given a Summary of Reasonable Adjustments, and they were also able to help me interrupt my course. \nThe only negative experience I had at UCL, was a lack of communication from my dissertation supervisor over my interupption, which caused me some issues. \nBut this is just a result of one, disorganised person. I successfully completed my master&#39;s dissertation regardless of this issue. Since I had good experience in the rest of my course, I wouldn&#39;t let this bad experience stop me from recommending UCL to any prospective students!",

They have many extracurricular societies and activities to join, and the campus is a mix of classical architecture and modern spaces. I spent a lot of time in the various libraries and in the cosy Print Room cafe. The thing that made my study experience sometimes difficult was the fact that during these years I always had a job on the side so I could pay the expensive London rent, and I would leave class running to my next work shift. I have epilepsy which means that I need a lot of rest, and have always prioritised work, study and rest over other activities which could have made my London experience a little sweeter. I gave my all to my studies, but I would have been able to make even more of this opportunity, had I had the extra hours every week.

As a student with a background in business, I&#39;m thinking about this program as a way to get more education and better job opportunities.\n\nThis program&#39;s global focus is one of its main benefits. The program is offered on six ESCP campuses—Warsaw, Berlin, London, Madrid, Paris, and Turin—giving students a unique chance to learn about different business cultures and environments. This worldwide viewpoint is critical in the present globalized economy, and it is something that I esteem in a postgraduate program.\n\nThe educational plan of the Expert in Business The executives program covers a large number of points in business the board, including financial matters, money, showcasing, and hierarchical way of behaving. Additionally, leadership development is emphasized in the program, which is necessary for success in business management positions. The educational plan is intended to give understudies a complete comprehension of how organizations work, and how they can be overseen successfully.\n\nThe faculty is yet another significant advantage of this program. A group of seasoned academics and industry professionals instruct the program, bringing a wealth of knowledge and practical experience to the classroom. This invaluable combination of academic rigor and hands-on experience ensures that students receive a comprehensive education.\n\nLast but not least, the Master of Business Administration program at ESCP Business School gives students a wide range of chances to gain practical experience through internships and consulting projects. Students can use what they&#39;ve learned in real-world situations and gain valuable experience through these opportunities, which will prepare them for business management careers in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, anyone seeking a high-quality postgraduate education in business management should consider enrolling in the Master in Business Management program at ESCP Business School. With its worldwide concentration, extensive educational plan, experienced personnel, and useful experience open doors, this program is an amazing pathway to outcome in the realm of business. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The London campus, on the other hand, offered me access to a wealth of industry expertise, thanks to its status as a hub for business and finance in Europe.\n\nThe highlight of my ESCP experience was undoubtedly the study trip to Silicon Valley. I was thrilled to witness firsthand the workings of some of the world&#39;s most innovative companies, and the exposure to the epicenter of tech innovation and entrepreneurship provided me with a unique perspective and a valuable set of skills that I know will serve me well in my career.\n\nAs a marketing and digital media student, I appreciated the school&#39;s strong emphasis on innovation and technology in business. The marketing program is designed to provide students with the latest tools, techniques, and trends in the field, and the experiential learning approach means that I was able to gain practical experience while studying.\n\nThe school&#39;s extensive alumni and industry partner network also provided me with numerous opportunities to connect with professionals in my field and gain valuable insights into the industry.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend ESCP Business School to anyone who is interested in a career in business and marketing. Its international network, experiential learning approach, and focus on innovation and technology make it an excellent choice for students who want to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing business landscape. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

The course is supplemented with Geography, Environmental Science and Town Planning, some of which is useful- like learning data handling skills and surveying, practical stuff. However there is SO much filler. There is very little good sustainability content. What is there is great but that doesn't cut it. Plus the fact this degree is a Masters of Arts even though you do all the same work as those who have an Environmental Science degree, who instead get the shiny Bsc. This means a lot in the job world and has been really detrimental for me. Masters of arts is as if you studied philosophy.\n\nIn my final year, I had to take a course called 'Introduction to Sustainability' and another on Urban Conservation - not environmental conservation but about buildings. This was a module for fourth year Town Planning students not sustainability students. There was no specialisation. Go somewhere else to study sustainability, it is a great thing to get into.",

Care of people has always been my passion and ultimate source of happiness. After 6 months of intensive nursing theory and skills laboratory simulations, we were released to the clinical area in the wards. On my first day at the clinical area, i remember vividly being allocated to work along with a senior nurse. During the shift, a patient calls in one of the rooms, i quickly check my report book to confirm the name of the patient and the diagnosis before i responded to the call bell. A Mr. X , 51 years with a diagnosis of Colo-rectal carcinoma . Being a novice student on my very first day, i was excited to respond to the call bell. When i reached the bed side, the patient requested for a bed pan, i quickly rushed to the sluice room and obtained a bed pan and informed my mentor during the shift. when i returned to the room, my patient said he wants to have a urinal first. I again quickly rushed to pick the urinal from our store. No sooner did i return to the room than the patient dropped on the floor with jerky movements.I quickly rushed to press the emergency cardiac bell to get help. Efforts to resuscitate our patient went futile, for over 45 minutes, we could not manage to save the life.\nA sad incident on my debut in nursing. This experience shaped my overall view of my dream career. I appreciated how the intensive care emergency team responded to the emergency and the tireless efforts put in by each staff member, on my very first day in the clinical area, i managed to perform a cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.\nI liked the fact that the incident that caught me as a novice student really shaped my skills and will to always be alert and yearn to study extensively to acquire knowledge which can help our people to live longer to achieve their purpose in life. Since then, i developed a passion to one day specialize as an oncology nurse since this was my very first cause of death i witnessed. I look forward to be a master of oncology care and treatment options.",

Students waste too many hours at the school park waiting for available buses to transport them either in or out of the school on a daily basis.

The course gives you access to industry-standard camera equipment and editing software. Plus, as a surprise bonus, with the modules and optional modules that I&#39;ve done so far (I&#39;m now going into year 4), I&#39;ve only needed to do two exams, both of them being online and multiple-choice! The rest of my work has been essays, reports, and presentations. That said, it&#39;s by no means perfect. The course can feel quite focused on journalism sometimes, especially in years 1 and 2. However, the optional modules combat this, with these modules allowing me to find my passion for marketing. Also, I&#39;ve found that some modules can be quite repetitive and/or basic. I wanted to be challenged more. My favourite thing about my course has definitely been the blended online and on-campus experience of it all. Yes, this was originally due to covid, but post-covid, some of my lectures continued to be online since they worked so well. \nThe campus is great. As I travel by bus, GCU is perfect! It&#39;s one road away from the bus station. It literally couldn&#39;t get any closer. The food and drinks on offer are great too, with there being veggie and vegan options as well, along with a Starbucks on campus. \n\n\nOverall, I&#39;d recommend GCU. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

It is basically where we create our own product which can be sold in stores and restaurants. Other than that, we also have subjects that are based on accounting and finance too. There is one subject which helps in understanding how to basically manage an operation. If someone is into HR and some subjects like that, we have got subjects that cover up that as well. The professors are really nice. \nThe bad bits:\nThe assignments, they change their format whenever a new batch shows up. So it is quite tough for a new batch to understand how to do the assignments. The dates for their submissions can fall in the week or even days, so it does become tough to handle them. The u-search, which is a part of their academic website, which they say we can use it to search books, is not very useful. Most of the books I have looked for, I couldn&#39;t find them.

For example, i found that they gave students very little information about our future studies until last minute despite other universities making decisions and informing students much earlier. I also found that during this time very little support was given to students at a time when we needed it the most. Support was given when face-to-face before the pandemic so why should this support stop when everybody is forced to work remotely? \n\nTo conclude, UCB should&#39;ve focused on adapting not just their way of teaching, but how to support students as it would&#39;ve helped students so much more in such a challenging time. Despite this though UCB&#39;s main strengths are their course content and facilities. Once they become more adaptable in all areas they will be a 5 star University that&#39;s for sure. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Socializing can be through the university societies, which there are many to choose from in both sporting and non-sporting, as well as outside of the university from the local area. \n\nMy course at the University being Accounting and Finance, in my experience I have delivery of the course is a reflection of the lecturer who delivers the course.

This was most highlighted after my exchange abroad, where I had noticed the different in the consistent content provided and ease of communication with lecturers at my host university, in comparison to BU.

This meant I lacked a lot of fundamental physiological knowledge that I needed in terms of understanding how to treat the deteriorating patient when in practice. I would also consider incorporating more practical teaching elements, such as clinical skills. The placements provided were good, however more could be done to ensure variety of placements for students by taking into account their previous work experiences and desires in terms of career goals- instead of random allocations.

In just about 37 hours of lectures I have been taught way more abroad than in about 50+ (not including seminars) hours at Bournemouth.\n\nA few of the units of my course are also just repeats of what we have done before. In some cases there indeed are new things, but the lecturer never focuses on them.\n\nSome lecturers have been found to be inconsiderate or not caring about the students. For instance, there has been a case of a two-people project that I did 100% by myself, because my partner wasn't interested and the lecturer clearly not caring about the issue as, when emailed about it, she would talk about irrelevant information. The same lecturer, may I add, always delayed the start of her lecture by ten to fifteen minutes to play a song on repeat. Then she would run out of time at the end of the lecture.\nIn another case I waited four weeks for a response from the lecturer regarding an assignment due soon. From another lecturer I didn't get a response at all.\n\nThe mental health services at Bournemouth are lackluster. When going through a really rough patch in my life that was causing me to think about suicide daily, I ended up reaching out to the University for help. With an initial interview looking more into my issues taking place about two weeks later, I wasn't invited for anything more until May and even then the University was not able to offer any more help aside from a set of sessions focused on tips, such as the fight or flight system or 'don't lay in bed in free time to stop associating it with non-sleep activities'. Tips that were either obvious or completely missing my issues.\n\nThe Talbot Campus is quite frankly a boring place with few decorations and little to no nice places to spend time in. And I have to ask why does it have more coffee shops than the entirety of my hometown?",

This is important for many students who would like to have an image of the next semester and how to plan it. \n \n\n Furthermore, such online program is not totally isolated. 4 webinars are held each semester to facilitate communication between lecturers and students, not to mention the various threads available for casual talk among students. \n \n\n Lastly, and most importantly, each student has the chance to contact his own tutor via email for any questions related to graded and ungraded assignments. Tutors help a lot by suggesting some books and articles for students to read. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Assignments are mostly essay based, but there are also some projects that test your skills in other areas e.g. we were asked to make a podcast for one of them. Teaching never feels pressured and teachers are forthcoming with help and support. There is ample time given to write a really great dissertation and plenty of support along the way. There is also the opportunity to take part in weekly meetings of the urban history school and engage with lecturers and PhD students. The environment at the university is lovely, even though the whole course took place online. The lecturers and seminar leaders are all experts of the highest quality in their fields.

However, it would be beneficial for the university to at least give courses in scientific writing at degree level as before university students have only ever written at A-level standard. It is a bit like getting thrown into the deep end and when asking for help, it is often dismissed and you are told to figure it out as tutors say that they are not allowed to help with assignments. The best part of the course was the final year research project where you got to decide your topic. I thoroughly enjoyed mine and was based in a hospital where I not only refined lab skills but got to undertake an intense research thesis with the support of my supervisor who was faultless. If I could review this part alone, I would give 5 stars. Although this was challenging, it has taught me invaluable skills. My final year was during covid which meant the university was a bit unorganised. we had no idea of what our final year exams would be until very shortly before they occured and had no guidance.\n\nin terms of resources, the library was always overcrowded but the online portal was good. the university was undergoing an extension so this may be solved now. the university were considerate with personal circumstances and did allow us alternative deadlines etc if we had sufficient reason. there were good mental health resources available.

The professors and lecturers are all highly knowledgeable in their subject areas and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure their students understand the material. Additionally, the university has a great sense of community, and there are always events and activities that allow students to get involved and build connections with others.\n\nHowever, one aspect of the university I find challenging is the workload. The academic expectations are very high, and students are expected to complete a significant amount of coursework each week. This could sometimes be overwhelming, and sometimes I feel like there is not enough time in the day to complete everything I require.\n\nOverall, I recommend Durham University to anyone seeking a high-quality academic experience in a supportive and dynamic environment.

One of the best things from this university is that each student is allocated to one of the 17 colleges in university, and each college has also its own values and traditions.

          "review": "I think Durham University is an ordinary but unique, rigorous but lively university, which not only witnesses history, but also creates the future.\n I like the ordinary but unique Durham University. The collegiate system of Durham University is very unique, and the sense of belonging it brings to students is irreplaceable. Especially as an international student, when I just came to study and live in a foreign country, the existence of the collegiate system helped me quickly adapt to the environment and find friends in tune. Everything in the college made me feel at home. \n Although the school has devoted a lot of energy to building the &#39;collegiate system&#39;, it is no different from other schools. Besides the collegiate system, it does not ignore the sense of learning experience of each student&#39;s major, such as regular lectures and internship and employment guidance activities for each major.\n I also like the preciseness but liveliness of Durham University. After I came to the university, every teacher I met was very responsible, and all the curriculum contents and examination contents of Durham University were carefully formulated, which required three levels of inspection, namely, the internal inspection of the school, the inspection of other schools and the inspection of a third-party authority. This is to ensure that students can learn the most knowledge and accumulate practical experience under the premise of moderate difficulty.\n Although the course content has been screened layer by layer, it is not rigid, but is optimized in real time according to the latest information in the profession. Teachers will also intervene in videos, animations and occasional jokes to interact with students. I guarantee that the classroom atmosphere of Durham University is very good.\n But frankly, I also have dissatisfaction with Durham University. Durham University sometimes has an overly strict attitude, which will lead to slow progress and sometimes low efficiency. It is mainly reflected in the speed of CAS issuance for international students and the issuance of student cards. Although this has not had a serious impact on students&#39; study and life, the long wait will also breed anxiety. \n In addition, the learning system and other web design of Durham University are not &#39;modern&#39; enough. In fact, the interaction logic can be clearer and more responsive to the times. Moreover, the web page occasionally appears stuck, especially the application page.\n Finally, I would like to recommend Durham University to others, because it can provide good support for students&#39; life and study. This university is worth spending four years to understand, and I believe Durham University can provide students with a better future. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

But all doubts proved to be unnecessary. The program is intense with a lot of assignments and study time needed outside of lectures, but I have learned a lot during the last half year. The professors are absolute experts in their field and are very helpful. The program is a good combination of theoretical lectures and practical lab work which allows to develop manual conservation skills while at the same time to learn about the theory and reasoning behind the procedures. We started working on real archaeological and museum objects after only a few weeks.

          "review": "This review solely applies to my own experience at Durham, I look back at my time there very fondly and am glad that I went, but I feel there are many aspects to consider before you decide to go here. I don't think it is possible to say objectively whether this is a good or bad university, but hopefully this helps you consider whether your motivations, personality and expectations make this the right university for YOU. \n\nFor some background on me, I come from Europe but all of my friends at uni ended up being English and so I really learned a lot about english living and culture. I would sum up my experience as great socially and extracurricularly but disappointing academically. Personally, I didn't really mind as I think there is much more to learn at university than just academics including life skills and social skills, but this depends on your reasons for going to university. Some of the negative factors I will mention are just useful things to keep in mind when you arrive - no place is perfect and that is the beauty of it. If you do go, take advantage of the HUGE good side of Durham. On to the pros and cons:\n\nPROS\n-COLLEGE SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC: allows you to make friends, attend formals and basically have a built-in social life from the very first week, fresher's week! You get to meet people from all different course subjects (don't worry too much about which college, as everyone ends up thinking their college is the best. Having said that, let me plug my own college - Hild Bede. It's very underrated but I believe it's the best because of it's large size, great sports teams, very convenient location, incredible balls/formals and down-to-earth students, as I have heard from friends that the students can be very posh in other colleges, though I have no personal experience)\n-EASY ADAPTATION to 'real life' for 18 year olds, by transitioning from home to college in first year and from college to a house with friends in second (In first year you don't have to cook, clean or pay bills, and you can learn together with your friends when you share a house)\n-GOOD, CHEAP NIGHTLIFE which means you can go out many times a week (not the best quality of clubs, but there is still a wide choice of over ten different clubs and plenty of bars. You can go out on less than 10 pounds - drinks are cheap in the northeast and even subsidised in college bars, many clubs don't charge entry and you can easily walk home so no taxi fares) \n-MANY PARTIES AND EVENTS! Many opportunities to go out (This could be a negative if you don't like going out. For internationals - be prepared for England's widespread drinking culture, which is easy to get caught up in. Most students drink unhealthy amounts and many get blackout drunk on a weekly basis. If you don't drink you will be a tiny minority)\n-BEAUTIFUL CITY AND RIVER, this is actually a very significant factor! Makes you happy every day. Especially since everything is within walking distance so you spend a lot of time outside.\n-MUCH CHEAPER than university in London, or the south in general\n-MANY SOCIETIES that cater to any and all of your interests\n-SPORTS FOR ALL LEVELS, with options to play competitively at university level or at college level for a more relaxed, friendly atmosphere (with plenty of social events with your teams!)\n-GOOD SPORTS PERFORMANCE compared to other English universities, especially in team sports (rugby, rowing, etc.) and the kit is really nice!\n-PLENTY TO DO despite Durham's small size and Newcastle is only just a 10-minute train ride away for great shopping, eating and nightlife.\n-SHORT TERM DATES and very long holidays! (almost 6 months throughout the year, though some of this is study leave)\n-SO MANY COFFEESHOPS. They often have study spaces too! If this is your thing, you will not be disappointed.\n-ACADEMIC CONTENT - the content of the courses isn't actually bad, as per Durham's world class reputation. What I struggled with was the approach to teaching, lack of interaction and extremely intense exam schedule. I would have expected more from such a reputable university. More on that below.\n\nCONS\nNote: My opinion on the academic standard at Durham solely applies to my degree course (Natural Sciences). I have heard that other degree subjects are different - contact hours vary widely and so do exam sessions. Check out your individual degree programme\n-ASSESSMENT PERIOD - this was my BIGGEST struggle and I believe it was the same for many other students, especially in the sciences. There is only one examination period all year which makes up 100% of your grade, so you have to revise everything you learned all year. Especially if you are slightly lazy and partial to procrastination like me, this is a recipe for disaster, even if you are very interested in your studies. Exam schedules can be brutal - as an example, I once had three exams in two days and I barely slept for a week in preparation, so I was very delusional by the last exam and did not perform my best. Huge source of unecessary stress and mental health issues for students (I actually know of several students committing suicide in my time there). For students in the humanities, you may have more essay-based assignments throughout the year, but exams are still all concentrated in only one month and you are at the mercy of the schedule you are allocated.\n-INTERDISCIPLINARIANS BEWARE! If you are applying to a natural sciences (me) or social sciences programme, make sure you can do what you want. There are many rules and prerequisites for what courses you can take in each year, so the flexibility that is advertised is not a reality. Sometimes your degree can even be LESS flexible than pure subject takers, because you have to take the compulsory modules of multiple subjects which doesn't leave room for optional modules. In addition, there may not be anyone taking your exact combination of modules, so it can be difficult to find study friends and very complicated to figure out your schedule.\n-DISAPPOINTING ACADEMIC APPROACH - the learning process is far less engaging, interactive and efficient compared with school. In chemistry, physics and maths at least, the vast majority of learning is done in lectures and there is not much practical work or opportunity for feedback/teacher contact.\n-LECTURERS seem to view teaching as a burden and are mostly at Durham to conduct research, not to teach, so lectures and tutorials can be quite dull (there are exceptions of course)\n-ADVERSE ATTITUDE TOWARDS LEARNING is widespread in students- this may be less the case for masters and PhDs, but I would say most bachelor's students (including me, admittedly) are just there to have a good time, not to study. Phrases like 'I hate my degree' and 'I hate studying' are commonplace.\n-HIGH NUMBER OF POSH STUDENTS, also known as rahs, I would say around half (not positive or negative per se, but you can always just stay away from that crew if you're not keen and I would recommend looking into the social vibe of different colleges to choose the right one for you) INTERNATIONALS: Social class is very important in England, at least compared to mainland europe, and it may come as quite a shock to you that the school you attended, your accent, your clothes and your upbringing appear to be very important in some circles. I'm not a fan of this.\n-CLIQUEY! From what I've heard of other English universities, this is a very Durham thing and not a countrywide phenomenon. Parties can be exclusive and strangers are not very friendly, on the whole.\n-INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS think this through. There are really not many international students at all here (try universities around London instead) and they mostly stick to each other like glue. English people are incredibly fun and loyal once you get to know them, but the culture can be difficult to permeate, and at first, locals may not be particularly friendly/open to you. You know yourself best, if you feel like you can easily permeate a new culture, this can be a great time and an insight into English life. By the end of my time here, I honestly felt English, and I thought of Durham as my home. If not, your years here could turn out to be quite lonely and you may feel very different to those around you, or you may be in a small circle of international students. As I believe that the biggest perks of Durham are NOT the academics, I would not come here if your top priority is studies, especially considering the extortionate international fees.\n-RATHER STUFFY - there is a huge emphasis on tradition and prestige (Oxbridge vibes, especially in a college like Castle or Hatfield). Again, as with most points on this list, this depends on your perspective. But I would argue that the old-fashioned nature is impressive from without, but cumbersome from within. Living in old college buildings is uncomfortable, cramped and cold, and some installations are hugely outdated (There was asbestos in my first-year dorm walls!!). Having older, experienced professors can mean their teaching methods and knowledge are often outdated and boring. Nevertheless, the traditional buildings are undeniably beautiful.\n-MANY STUDENTS HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. Eating out, going out and going on holiday are commonplace, and you may find it difficult to keep up if you're a bit pressed for cash.\n-HOUSING is honestly a nightmare. There are not enough houses for all the students that go here, and there is a lot of pressure to rent a house very early on when you barely know who you want to live with. To make matters worse, housing companies increase rent pretty much every year and take advantage of young students. \n-FACILITIES in general are overcrowded - it is impossible to find a space in the library during exam season. (Fear not though, you can head to any of the aforementioned coffeshops instead!)\n\nHaving said all of these things, I think that Durham is sufficiently large that everyone can find their place. If you don't like the people you first meet, there are thousands more, and hundreds of societies to join in order to do just that. If you feel stuck, branch out and meet someone new! I would recommend talking to someone who has been there, if you can. In my opinion, this will give you much more insight thanchecking the website or even visiting the university in person. This university is a great experience if you come in with the right mindset, you will honestly have a fabulous time and meet friends and housemates you will keep in touch with for life.",

When I arrived in England, I was completely alone, which was not a problem at all. I had been living in a small city near Rome for 20 years of my life (since I was born, basically) and I needed to experience something new, to create a new life by myself. During my 6 months of Erasmus, I lived my best life. The place were I lived is called Durham and it is simply the students' paradise. The city itself is incredibly beautiful: the atmosphere is so relaxing and you can study, party, meet new people or just take time for yourself whenever you want. \nThe University system is great. I studied very much, learnt lots of new things and I opened myself even more to other cultures and habits. I met so many beautiful souls from all over Europe (mainly): they became my amazing international family in a very short time. We shared the best experiences together. In addition to all of this, I must say that England is an incredible country: they have so many beautiful traditions and values and let you feel as part of those too. \nBy way of conclusion, I want to say that Eramus is a great opportunity for each student and everyone should try it! It is the best way to learn new languages, open your mind, understand who you truly are, what do you expect from the reality that surrounds you and broaden your horizons.\nThe only thing that I have to complain about concerns the period of the application for Erasmus (I speak for my home university in particular): things should be explained better and people who work for it should be more helpful.

I have found a great community here. After transferring from a university in the United States, I was nervous about starting school abroad, never having been to Aberdeen before. But switching to UoA was the best thing I could have done. \nAll in all, I have really enjoyed my time studying in Aberdeen, and I would recommend the uni to students looking for an engaging environment in a fun town. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

I thought I was cool that I can do everything at once, but when I entered college, I found out that I was the opposite of how I see myself.\n\nGoing back to my first day in the university, I felt something I could not even put into words. Seeing new faces, new surroundings made me feel like I’m in a very different place. It was my first time to see the people whom I’ll be with for the rest of my stay in the university and it made me nervous for an unknown reason. All of us need to adjust well so that we can survive and know each other well. Subjects for the first time like Philosophy,taxonomy, and ecology were very hard to study since it was the first time for me to encounter.\nWaking up, preparing to go to school, studying before class, being in class, going home, studying until before the sun rises, eating in between of those, sleep, then wake up again. Halfway of my stay in the university, my days became like that. People would think that it was easy having a day like that, but in reality, it was the opposite. I was thinking of giving up and try another course, but I still decided to continue.\n\nI still haven’t really figured out what I really wanted to do with my life. Day by day, it was getting hard. Harder than I expected. I thought and realized I need to love what I am doing to ease the burden that I am experiencing. I wanted to prove to myself that I can do things that I thought I would never be able to do. Then, it just went into me that I want to become a nurse, a great one.\n\nFast forward to the present. As expected, my life really turned into a routine. It never became as interesting as how other live theirs. If anyone would want to try to be in my shoes, I think, he or she may not last a day being me. Today will be the same as yesterday and maybe the next day will be the same as today. I guess eating, sleeping, and talking to my friends are the only things I consider as leisure,though it&#39;s like a drilling which on the long run I enjoyed.",

I have discovered all the opportunities that university offers me. Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology is a very welcoming place, and from the first day, I felt at home. I have made so many friends from different backgrounds. There are Nigerians and Senegalese students in my hostel of residence and that has allowed me an insight into their cultures.\nMy classes were great and I enjoyed every one of them, especially Valuation. The depth and detail of what we were learning is far beyond my high school experience. Valuation is interesting because, just as there are variety of reasons for seeking a business valuation, there are several different types of valuation methods which can be used to calculate a fair and defensible value for the business or its assets. Therefore, selecting the best valuation method is the first step in establishing the value of the business or business assets. This has made me realize how and when to use this valuation methods and how to carry out valuation. This was probably the best part of university. It has introduced so many new concepts that changes our view of the world. The course load is intense, so time management was key.\nAs for extracurricular activities, I was part of our department organizing committee where we organized field trips and games and for the department. Another thing I have really enjoyed on campus is going to the gym. I tried to go at least five times a week.",

Campus security is also very invasive of ones privacy if they feel you are a 'problem student'. I have had campus security flash their lights in my bedroom window and try entering my room at night to see if i had unwanted visitors or was smoking in the building just because my flatmate was a smoker. My mental health issues got very much in the way of me being able to do my studies well and the school was barely concerned with it. I was offered 6 sessions with a therapist, but otherwise no help with with how to manage my classes while trying to also manage my mental health. \n\nI would say there are better schools to go to, ones that communicate better with their students about the goings on of the school board as well, but if you want a small and quiet experience this is probably a decent fit.",

It&#39;s a top Russell group university and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable, at least from my research postgraduate perspective. The campus is dynamic and exciting, an interesting place visually with lots of places to study: the Brotherton is especially beautiful! There are also a good number of places to eat or grab a drink, and it&#39;s situated not far from the city centre which is perfect for going for food or doing some shopping in between lectures. The city itself is a true selling point: Leeds is a bustling and busy city with so much going for it.\n \n\n But the no. 1 thing I would always highlight about this university is that it&#39;s a friendly place to be. Everyone is ready and willing to help, which from my experience is not always the case at top universities. I&#39;m a first generation PhD student so there was a lot for me to learn, but everyone was super helpful. \n \n\n The only thing I would realistically mark negatively is that as a PhD student there&#39;s often confusion in terms of finding out what you&#39;re entitled to and how your course works. However, I feel like this is more to do with the PhD system as a whole needing work, and less to do with the university specifically, though the university&#39;s marking of PhDs is somewhat baffling and left me in a bit of a tricky place. I would still recommend the university over and over again though, because I&#39;ve been met with nothing but kindness and support from my supervisors and everybody I&#39;ve met in my department (Languages) and at the university. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

He wanted me to take Entrepreneur as my concentration, but at that time, I had made up my mind, I would take Wealth Planning as my concentration. It was like, one and only decision that I make in my life that I never regret even once. It opens my eyes to the outside world. \nI'm really glad to be able to pursue my study here, that I find what I want to become in the future. In here, I found my passion, I was urged to do more and learn more for life is a constant learning. I am always a person that tries to implement theory in practical, I tried to implement everything I learned from college in real life. Not everything goes smoothly, there are many things that go not as I planned, but then again, being in college, learning, isn't that the point? to make mistake and learn from it. \nIt is not something that I said to defend myself for taking a wrong decision, it was really a valuable lesson for me. I meet many friends and understand the value of friendship. I met many amazing lecturers that teach not only theory to learn, but discipline and great ethic work. They taught me to really position myself on the edge, to be really squeezed to find my true potential. I cannot say I have reached it, but I am definitely on my way!",

Throughout the course there has been a wide rang of modules available, ranging from Marketing to Film Making. \n\nDue to this, you really could tailor the degree to subjects that your were interested in and felt may help your career path. I liked the balance of academic skills such as essay writing which was vital for my course, weighted with studio practice work, in which you are required to produce a body of practical work demonstrating research, experimentation, development and refinement. This was what I struggled with the most in my course. Art is, of course, subjective. It was therefore difficult receiving feedback from tutors suggesting you do something like rip up a painting you had just spent hours creating. To add, all of our studio practice tutors were practising artists and none came from design back grounds.\n\nContinuing, there was no real \"design\" element to the course at all. I chose to study this degree because I was under the impression from the course overview and title that it would enhance my skills as a designer, not just as an artist. However there were not really any practical modules available to us to enhance design skills such as using computer softwares/CAD like Photoshop and Sketch Up. These are skills which are absolutely vital for design led employment and I feel very under prepared and a little scared without these skills.",

This kind of analysis help the company to make an appropriate decision at the appropriate time. Studying the methodology of strategic management and how to make a useful scenario taking into consideration all aspects of business ( financial, marketing, business modelling, sales, corporate culture, setting goals, segmenting, positioning, price strategy, and so on) Really is a study of a real business situation to tackle the difficult periods which any company faces today. Business today is a dynamic, fluctuated, impacted with many new factors internal and external. Need a new way of thinking with innovation as well as creativity based on academic tools and the sciences. All these tools i learnt them during my program of Dual DBA Strategic Management. SSBM gives us the opportunity to prepare research and present it in conference and event, as well as published it in GIPS and it is good opportunity to build a researcher which gives us a big confident in accomplishing our DBA research. EMAS give us the opportunity to prepare webinar for student of MBA or DBA as a part of our program training and i appreciate so much this kind of training to present a webinar because i like so much teaching and explaining.

Also, since i came from a research background and already have some background into research processes, i can attest to what they have been teaching as 100% accurate and reliable, or at least 99% for the benefit of doubt. I am thoroughly enjoying the study while knowing that it is still a very rigorous programme and is definitely high quality education to bring out the best in me. I have absolutely no qualms about recommending this programme for anyone interested. SSBM is a business school and they never claimed to be a university. However, as a private business school, they have some awesome accreditations like ACBSP and IACBE candidacy that attest to the quality education they provide. Great experience and i am sure they will surely get AACSB in future to be in the similar rank of business schools like INSEAD.

The staff is extremely kind and attentive, welcoming all in the best way.\nThe founder's principles and philosophy for the school was also something that had me instigated to take this course, considering that I am looking for further practical knowledge and networking in my area of work. \nIn my view the school could enhance greatly if the classes methodology and the school philosophy could be more aligned with the actual classes and program description. Personally, the traditional exams and grading methods don't seem to complement the human aspects and motivation I found on the school's mission statement.\nOverall, my personal experience was average mostly due to my course program being deeply modified, missing 3 out of 4 courses I was really looking into such as Foundation in Art History, International Business Decision Making and E-Business/E-Commerce. Instead, my program included Events Management, International Project Management and Buyer Behavior, leaving only the Arts Marketing & Business of the original program.\nSpecifically for the courses I attended, I would like to see more talks and guests within the area, reinforcing critical discussions about contemporary Culture and Arts, its foundations, how it works and how to engage professionally whether on local or international scene. Since it's a specific niche of interest, I was hoping to see more engagement and know-how as also a positive dispositive for students like myself who are optimistic to develop new projects, especially in Florence. \nAt last, I am happy for knowing the school and the people involved with. Indeed during these months there were great guests invited for live lectures, off campus visits and a very friendly atmosphere from the student's relations, fantastic in terms of keeping us all updated on what was happening in town and promoting the well needed happy hours.",

At the moment, I am doing my internship in one of the most prestigious institutions for Opera Lyrica in Italy, the Puccini Festival in Torre del Lago and I see every day my dream coming to life.\n\nThere is not a perfect educational institution, but when you choose to focus on the positive aspects and how they can help you evolve, then you can get the greatest benefit out of any institution.

I would say that the course (module) enrollment process needs to be reformed because it takes place during welcome week and can be very stressful for students still dealing with moving in and settling down to have to also choose their courses. For my programme specifically, I was given priority about selection for media and gender modules but I am aware that other programmes do not have this security. For example Gender, Development and Globalisation students do not have priority in the Development department meaning that there are courses that they came to the university to take that they have not been able to enrol in.\n \n\n In terms of teaching, I would say that most of the lectures are very good; they are engaging and compelling. Some lecturers should work on being able to engage with the class without reading only from a script. The seminars are where I have found the teaching becomes much more variable. Some seminars I have, particularly in the gender department lack structure and inspiration. I sometimes think the concepts are not being pushed to their critical limits. Saying this, one of my seminars has recently improved after we gave the seminar leader our feedback. And, as far as an underfunded gender department goes, they are doing very well. They create an inclusive environment for learning in which I feel comfortable. I just wish it were a little more inspiring. \n \n\n I also feel that they should give us more assignments because the structure of only doing two essays per course is not pushing me and it is not allowing us to reach our investigative potential as critics. <br><i> Review provided by EDUopinions (www.eduopinions.com)</i>",

Strong academic performance in the first year resulted in the opportunity to enter a newly established academic programme, the dual-degree Economics and Finance programme, which is taught in English using LSE materials and curriculum, organized jointly by the University of London and University of Belgrade. . The programme results in two degrees: one from the University of London (LSE) and the other from the University of Belgrade. The last four years of my undergraduate studies have represented an excited journey of personal and professional and personal growth. Enrolling University of London and University of Belgrade was the first stage in an acute period of personal growth, which has affirmed my motivation to advance my skills while preparing me for a dynamic international career.",

Unlike elsewhere, the academic staff here with high reputation around the world are always happy to help, to hear and to resonate. During the outbreak of pandemic and the lockdown, it was by their support I made through the tough time. The courses provided by the programme is challenging as well and this argument is not from its difficulties in reading, but from the fact that it challenges mindset of everyone from the every beginning, say, the feminist, postcolonial, and developmental theories even overturn my pre-established perception of the world, helping me to realise how truth is obscured and misrepresented by the discursive construction of media and everyday lives. Overall, the LSE experience for me is a continuous and recursive deconstruction and reconstruction of ideas, a disarmament and rearmament of myself, expanding the ways in which I can interpret and understand the world and take actions to change it, very firmly.",

It would have been even better if there were assignments because then a lot of research and practical knowledge will come into play. \n\nThe degree programme covered various segments in finance so i was able to get a wider knowledge in finance.

Though I had been scared previously by what I had read online about it being difficult to maintain a good social life, I have found that not to be true. With a little bit of initiative (putting yourself out there and trying new things), it is very easy to meet people - whether you will like them will depend on your luck. It is a good place for someone who is used to international environments, as there are many international students. I found I was able to fit into that easily, and was not overwhelmed by an inability to integrate into local culture, which some of my friends at other universities expressed.\n\nThe academic side has been almost flawless. I find LSE has the best structure of all undergraduate law degrees, as it reduces the time spent studying compulsory subjects and has a wider range of choice in optional modules than most universities of comparable reputation. The courses are extremely intellectually engaging (if you enjoy legal thinking). I don't know whether that has to do with the course content itself or the teaching - the teaching is much better than expected, but it is not the thing that stood out to me from academic life (with some notable exceptions, some teachers are extremely committed). Overall a good experience, I only regret not having had more time to take advantage of everything it had to offer.",

It was sometimes difficult to find the required reading, but I found most of it through the online portal, or in my local university library. The online forum had verting levels of interaction, but in general I felt it was underused by the students in favour of other tools/ communication apps. The online forums for some modules were moderated, which helped understand some of the course elements more effectively. In general, the support, guidance was sufficient for me.
